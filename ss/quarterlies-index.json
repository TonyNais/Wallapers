        "introduction": "### The Gospel of Mark\n\nFrom the beginning of Mark, the reader knows who Jesus is—the Messiah, the Son of God (Mark 1:1). However, people in the story struggle with understanding just who He is and what He is all about—except for those with demons. They know exactly who He is! The demons recognize Him and wither before His mighty words.\n\nBut Jesus rather consistently commands that they keep this information quiet. Why this command for secrecy? Bible students for centuries have mulled over this question. It even has a name in scholarship—the Messianic Secret. Why would Jesus want to keep quiet about who He is?\n\nWhat will become clear in this journey through the Gospel of Mark is that not only is there secrecy in this book—there is also amazing revelation. It can rightly be called the Revelation/Secrecy Motif, and it runs through the Gospel of Mark. Although at the end of the book, all the secrecy is surprisingly replaced with a powerful revelation of Jesus.\n\nMark can be divided into two distinct sections—halves, actually. Chapter one through near the end of chapter eight deals with the crucial question, Who is Jesus? The answer is displayed in His teachings and His miracles. Again and again, He defeats evil, brings hope to the oppressed, and teaches compelling truths that cut to the heart of human existence. All this shouts to the reader that He is the Messiah, the Christ, whom the Hebrew people have long been awaiting.\n\nHowever, it is not until the middle of the book that someone not demon-possessed rightly declares who He is, thereby answering the question of the first half of the book about Christ’s identity. And that person is Peter, who  declares, “ ‘You are the Christ’ ” (Mark 8:29, ESV).\n\nThe second half of Mark, from Mark 8:31 to the end of the book, answers the other question, Where is Jesus going? The answer is shocking. He is going to the cross, the most ignominious and shameful manner of death in the Roman world. And it is such an unexpected destination for the Messiah, who His followers think will defeat Rome and establish Israel as a powerful nation.\n\nJesus’ bumbling disciples cannot fathom what He is saying. As the book progresses, they ask less and less about this painful topic, until finally they are reduced to silence in the face of the unwelcome truth.\n\nThings look gloomier and gloomier when Jesus confronts the religious leaders who plot His demise. The disciples, hopeful of a glorious kingdom, are shocked by an arrest, trial, and crucifixion that defies their expectations.\n\nBut through all this, Jesus keeps a clear and consistent message of where He is going and what it means that He will die and rise again. The bread and cup of the Last Supper will represent His body and blood (Mark 14:22–25), and He will become a ransom for many (Mark 10:45).\n\nThis does not mean He went to the cross in stoic calmness. In Gethsemane He struggles with the decision (Mark 14:32–42), and on the cross He cries out in despair, “ ‘My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?’ ” (Mark 15:34, NKJV). The Gospel of Mark shows us the darkness that Christ experienced, the cost of our salvation. But the cross is not the end of the journey. After His resurrection, He plans a meeting with His disciples in Galilee—and, as we know, the Christian church began.\n\nIt is a most remarkable story, told in a terse, fast-moving style with little commentary from the Gospel writer himself. He simply tells the story, and then lets the words, the deeds, the actions speak for themselves regarding the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n_Thomas R. Shepherd, PhD, DrPH, is senior research professor of New Testament at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary, Andrews University. He and his wife, Sherry, have two grown children and six grandchildren._",

        "introduction": "### God's Grace Builds Community\n\n**Dear student,**\n\nYou are a gift from God, and He loves you very much! If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

        "introduction": "### Dear parents,\n\nIn this issue of the Kindergarten Bible Study Guide you will find that the lessons are from the life of Jesus. In these lessons the children will be introduced to three major themes—service through following Jesus’ example; experiencing God’s grace by being part of His family; and worshipping by praising Jesus for what He has done for us.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.\n\nContact us through our Web site at www.gracelink.net. - Cordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### Introduction\n\nThe Book of Mark tells the story about Jesus’ life and His work on earth. From the beginning of the Book of Mark, the reader knows who Jesus is. Jesus is the promised Savior, the Son of God (Mark 1:1). But the people in the story have a hard time understanding who Jesus is and what He came to earth to do. Everyone in the Book of Mark has a hard time understanding, except for the people filled with demons. The demons are afraid of Jesus and His mighty words. The demons know exactly who Jesus is!\n\nJesus commands the demons to keep this information secret. Why does Jesus tell the demons to tell no one who He is? Bible students have wondered about the answer to this question for hundreds of years. This topic has a special name: the Savior’s Secret. Why does Mark want us to keep quiet about who Jesus is?\n\nWe will soon learn the answer. As we study the Book of Mark, we will see that some things are kept secret, and some things are shown. At the end of the Book of Mark, all the secrets about Jesus end in a surprising way. The secrets are replaced with a power­ful message about Jesus and who He is.\n\nWe can divide the Book of Mark into two parts. Chapter 1 to near the end of chapter 8 is about an important question. Who is Jesus? The answer is found in His teachings and miracles. Again and again, Jesus wins the fight against evil. He gives hope to people who are suffering and hurting. Jesus teaches important Bible truths. All these things tell the reader that Jesus is the Savior, the Promised One from God. Jesus is the Savior that the Hebrew people have waited a long time for.\n\nWe must wait until the middle of the Book of Mark to read about someone who isn’t filled with a demon to announce who Jesus is. This announcement answers the question in the first half of the book about who Jesus is. Peter is the one who announces, “ ‘You are the Christ [the Chosen One, the Savior]’ ” (Mark 8:29, ICB).\n\nThe second half of the Book of Mark starts with Mark 8:31 and goes to the end of the book. The second half of the Book of Mark answers the question, Where is Jesus going? The answer is surprising. Jesus is going to the cross. The cross was a symbol of shame in Bible times. The cross was the most terrible way a person could die in the kingdom of Rome. No one expects the Savior of the whole earth to end up there. His followers expect Jesus to beat Rome and make Israel a powerful country.\n\nJesus’ followers can’t understand what He is saying when He tells them He must die. As the Book of Mark continues, the followers ask Jesus fewer and fewer questions about this painful topic. They don’t want to hear about it because they want Jesus to throw the Romans out of Israel and start His kingdom on this earth.\n\nBefore Jesus dies, He meets the Jewish spiritual leaders who plan to kill Him. At this time, Jesus’ followers continue to hope that Jesus will start His kingdom on this earth. The followers of Jesus are surprised when He is arrested, then forced to stand trial, and finally is nailed to the cross. These terrible happenings destroy the followers’ hopes.\n\nAfter Jesus is arrested, He stays calm. Earlier, in Gethsemane, Jesus fought a ter­rible battle with Himself over His decision to die for our sins (Mark 14:32–42). Later, on the cross, Jesus feels no hope. He cries out in deep sorrow: “ ‘My God, My God, why have You left Me alone?’ ” (Mark 15:34, NLV). The Book of Mark shows us Jesus’ dark experience on the cross. The cross shows us how much it cost God to save us: the life of His Son. But the cross does not end Jesus’ work on earth. After Jesus wakes up from the dead, He meets with His followers in Galilee. As we know, this meeting is the start of the Christian church.\n\nThe Book of Mark is an amazing story about the life of Jesus. Mark tells the story in a fast-moving style of writing. He doesn’t offer us a lot of extra words or explanations for the things that happen. Mark just tells the story. He lets the words, the actions, and the miracles tell the story about the life and death of Jesus from Nazareth.\n\n_Thomas R.

        "introduction": "### Introduction\n\nJesus Christ was no doubt the greatest teacher the world has ever known. He amazed and astonished people with His teachings. His words reached men and women of all ages; Jews and Gentiles alike flocked to hear Him speak. Both the rich and poor, the educated and uneducated, found something in His instructions that touched the deepest chords of their hearts. Jesus’ words have continued to impact generation after generation in the years since He left the world; the gospel accounts have inspired millions. This incredible fact is really no surprise since Christ’s words were carefully crafted in the very heart of God—a God of love, a God who spoke and it came to be, a God who created human beings and placed within them a longing for truth.\n\nIn a world that was sunk in sin and separated from its Maker, Jesus came to reveal God’s loving character to humanity. To reach the sinful heart barricaded by pride and selfishness, Jesus called people’s attention to the principles that govern true happiness. Through practical illustrations and stories, He drew His audiences into a new world where healing and restoration could take place. Jesus called this new reality His kingdom. It’s a kingdom where love for God and for others is central. Everyone is invited, but Christ made it plain that not everyone would want to be a citizen of that kingdom.\n\nIt was through parables that Jesus explained what His kingdom is like. Using nature and illustrations from everyday life, He painted a vivid picture of what it means to follow Him and live in harmony with God. Parable teaching was popular at the time and commanded the respect and attention of both Jews and people from other nations. The word parable means to “cast alongside”—it’s a story given alongside spiritual truth, one that provides an avenue to more deeply explore the moral and spiritual reality. The different stories Jesus told appealed to many different people. The core truths of His kingdom were packaged in such a way that people from a wide variety of backgrounds could find purpose and meaning in His words. And so it is today! Christ’s parables continue to shape the lives of people all around the world.\n\nAs we read and study these transformative stories, we will be both inspired and challenged—inspired by the mind-blowing beauty of the gospel and challenged by the need to let Jesus change us from within. Jesus’ parables cover a wide range of topics, but they all center on the overarching theme of revealing what the kingdom of God is really like. In contrast to the way of life, there is a way that leads to death, and Christ’s parables warn us about this destructive road and remind us of the great controversy between good and evil that rages in this universe. In the end, there are only two sides in this cosmic conflict.\n\nThe parables engage our minds and hearts, revealing how we can tap into the power that comes from God. Through these lessons, we will discover the power available to us. Jesus told stories about the power of forgiveness and love, He invites us to experience the power that comes through prayer, and He assures us of the power that will be ours when we build our lives on Him, the Rock of Ages. Jesus shows us the unexpected power that comes through giving ourselves to serve others. He reveals what will last when the great storm, predicted in prophecy, sweeps across the world before Jesus’ return.\n\nThe parables uncover what really matters in this life and in eternity. Jesus reveals through His stories how we can be filled with the Holy Spirit as we await the coming of the Bridegroom. Yes, that’s right—we are invited to a wedding! And we don’t have to wonder what to wear; Jesus has provided a wedding garment! All this and more we will find in these extraordinary stories that transform.\n\nLet’s prayerfully embark on this journey together. It’s going to be both exhilarating and challenging. As we unpack each parable we will discover principles and tools that will help us properly interpret the meaning behind each story. May the stories that have touched millions make a difference in your life today. You are no accident; you were made for a purpose. Let Jesus, the greatest Teacher, reveal to you what that purpose is.\n\n_Daniel Pel_",

In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\n_Cordially, The Editors_",

        "introduction": "### The Great Controversy\n\nIf asked, “What central theme runs through all the Bible?” how would you respond? Jesus? The plan of salvation? The Cross? Yes to all three, of course! But these three important topics unfold against another all-encompassing theme: the great controversy. This theme pervades the Bible, from the book of Genesis to the book of Revelation.\n\nThe great controversy began in heaven with Lucifer’s rebellion against God. At the heart of this cosmic conflict is the issue of God’s love. Is He fully loving? Does He have the best interests of His creatures in view? Or is He an authoritative dictator desiring only what is in His own self-interest?\n\nThis quarter’s lessons trace world history from God’s viewpoint, as prophecy reveals it, from the time of Christ down through the centuries to our day and beyond. God’s very nature is love, and therefore, all His acts are loving, though this fact may not always be evident to finite human beings or even angels. But God’s love is progressively revealed as the great controversy unfolds. We see its height and depth most clearly through the Cross. At Calvary, God’s love was displayed before the entire universe, when Christ poured out His life to redeem humanity, and Satan’s ultimate defeat was assured.\n\nYet, the battle rages on. Satan tried to destroy Jesus on the cross and, through the centuries, we see him trying to destroy God’s people. Although Satan has viciously persecuted Christ’s church and slaughtered millions, God has always been present with His people and will never leave them.\n\nThis quarter will trace the major developments in the great controversy, beginning with the rebellion in heaven. We will explore the central issues of the conflict between Christ and Satan. We will see the indomitable courage of the Waldenses despite fierce persecution, and the determination of the Reformers to follow Bible truth even in the face of torture, chains, the stake, and martyrdom.\n\nCommenting on the faith of these spiritual giants, Ellen G. White states, “The Bible was their\n\nauthority, and by its teaching they tested all doctrines and all claims. Faith in God and His word sustained these holy men as they yielded up their lives at the stake.”—The Great Controversy, p. 249.\n\nThe Reformation kindled a torch of truth that still burns brightly. The Reformers’ bedrock faith in Scripture and their steadfast assurance of salvation by grace through faith paved the way for the rise of the Advent movement, championed by William Miller and a host of others around the world.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church was raised up by God to build on the foundation laid by the Reformers in order to restore biblical truths that had been lost sight of through the centuries. Central to its mission is proclaiming the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6–12, God’s final warning to a world soon to come to an end.\n\nThis proclamation arouses the wrath of Satan, pictured as a dragon by the apostle John: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ” (Rev. 12:17). We will also study the final events in the great controversy, including the triumph of God’s love over all the principalities and powers of hell, which ushers in the creation of new heavens and a new earth.\n\nThough the basis of this quarter’s lessons is the Bible, we will use the book The Great Controversy, by Ellen G. White, as our thematic outline in studying this tremendous topic. The chapters on which each lesson is based are noted to facilitate its use as a companion book for further study and sharing that we all might more fully “know the love of Christ which passes knowledge” (Eph. 3:19, NKJV).\n\n_A native of Connecticut, U.S.A., Mark Finley, an internationally known evangelist, was a vice president at the General Conference from 2005 to 2010. After retiring from full-time employment, he became an assistant to the president of the General Conference. Pastor Finley and his wife, Ernestine, have three children and five grandchildren._",

Each lesson comes out of the binding to be used as a separate sheet for study in advance during the week in preparation for Sabbath School. Be sure to take the right lesson to Sabbath School with you each week.\n\n**Step 2**: Use each week’s lesson in the way that is best for you. Each section has a day of the week listed beside it, but you may want to mix and match sections as you study. The sections work in any order.\n\n**Step 3**: Review the memory verse each day of the week.\n\n**Step 4**: Be prepared to share your thoughts and discoveries with your Sabbath School class.",

They want you to know more about God and His love for you and your family. And that’s what God wants too. He wants you to know that He loves you very much. And Jesus wants to be your special, forever friend. He wants you to know Him, to know all about Him. He wants you to be His friend too.\n\nAs you learn more about God’s love in these lessons, think about ways you can show your love to Him. Can you sing a song of praise to Him? Can you tell Him in your prayers how wonderful He is? Can you show His love to others in your family? To your friends and neighbors?\n\nWe pray that God will always have a special place in your heart. The Editors",

        "introduction": "### God's Grace Builds Community\n\n**Dear student,**\n\nYou are a gift from God, and He loves you very much! If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

In these lessons the children will be introduced to three major themes—service through following Jesus’ example; experiencing God’s grace by being part of His family; and worshipping by praising Jesus for what He has done for us.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.\n\nContact us through our Web site at www.gracelink.net. - Cordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### The War Between God and Satan\n\nWhat if someone asked you, “What is the most important idea in the Bible?” What would be your answer? Jesus? God’s plan to save sinners? The Cross? All these topics are important. But they are part of an even bigger topic in the Bible: the worldwide war between good and evil.\n\nThis war started in heaven when Lucifer fought against God. What is this war really all about? The answer may surprise you: God’s love. Is God a God of love? Does He care about the health and happiness of the ones He made? Or does He care only about Himself and expect everyone to obey Him without question?\n\nThis quarter’s Bible study guide seeks to answer these questions. We also will look at human history from God’s view. The Bible shows us God’s view of history. We will study what the Bible has to say about God’s view of history. God is love. So, everything He does is loving, even if humans or angels can’t always understand His actions. We see God’s love more and more as the war between good and evil continues to happen. We see God’s love the most at the cross. At Calvary, God showed His love to everyone in heaven and on earth when Jesus poured out His life to save us. At the cross, Jesus won the fight against Satan. The Cross is a promise that God will destroy sin and the devil forever.\n\nIn the meantime, the war between good and evil continues. Satan tried to destroy Jesus on the cross. After that, Satan tried to destroy God’s people. Satan has hurt God’s church and killed millions of Christians. But God has always been with His people. He never will leave them.\n\nThis quarter, we will look at what already has happened in the worldwide war between God and Satan. We will start with the war in heaven with Lucifer. We will examine the important topics in this war. We also will read about the courage of the Waldenses. The Waldenses stayed loyal to God when Satan used the church to attack them for their faith. We will learn about the Protestant leaders who took a strong stand for Bible truth. These leaders stayed loyal to God and the Bible when they were tortured, put in chains, burned alive, or killed.\n\nEllen G. White talks about these heroes of faith. She says, “The Bible showed these men God’s plan for their lives. They compared every new teaching and all ideas with Bible truth. These holy men had faith in God and in the Bible. Faith and Bible truth kept these men strong when they were burned alive in fire.”—The Great Controversy, page 249.\n\nThis quarter, we will look at the lives of some of these heroes of the Protestant Reformation: Wycliffe, Huss, Jerome, Luther, and Wesley. The Protestant Reformation was the time during the 1500s in Europe when religious leaders made big changes to the Catholic religion. These leaders rejected the false teachings of the Catholic Church. The changes they made led to the start of the Protestant churches. The leaders of the Protestant Reformation believed that God saves us with His mercy because of Jesus. Later on, William Miller accepted this idea and started to preach that Jesus was coming back in the year 1844.\n\nGod started the Seventh-day Adventist Church. God built this church on the important rules and beliefs of the Protestant Reformation. God has a very special plan for the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the end times. God wants the church to announce and teach important Bible truths that were hidden for hundreds of years. God also gave the Seventh-day Adventist Church the job of announcing to everyone on earth the Three Angels’ Messages of Revelation 14:6–12. These messages are God’s final warning to a ­planet that is soon to come to an end.\n\nSatan hates the Three Angels’ Messages. In the book of Revelation, John uses a dragon as a word picture for Satan: “Then the dragon was very angry at the woman. He went off to make war against all her other children. Her children are those who obey God’s commands and have the truth that Jesus taught” (Revelation 12:17, ICB). We will study the final things that happen in the war between God and Satan. We will learn how God’s love will win over Satan and his army of evil angels. After Satan and his followers are destroyed, God will make the skies and earth brand new.\n\nWe will study what the Bible says about how human history will end. We also will use the book The Great Controversy, by Ellen G. White, as our outline for studying about the war between God and Satan. At the start of each lesson, we will tell you which chapters in The Great Controversy to read for further study. May we all come to know more fully “the love of Christ. His love goes beyond anything we can understand. I pray that you will be filled with God Himself” (Ephesians 3:19, NLV). Paul’s prayer for his readers is our prayer for each of you, too, dear readers.\n\n_Mark Finley was born in the state of Connecticut in the United States of America. He has preached in many different countries worldwide. He worked as a top leader at the General Conference from 2005 to 2010. The General Conference is the headquarters for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. After Pastor Finley retired from full-time work, he worked part-time for the president of the General Conference. Pastor Finley and his wife, Ernestine, have three children and five grandchildren._",

        "introduction": "### Introduction to The Great Controversy\n\n#### The Essential Metanarrative\n\nAll human beings live by some metanarrative, worldview, or ideology that guides their perception of reality, and, consequently, their decision-making, ideas, and plans. Metanarratives influence how we interpret the events and world around us as well as the thoughts and feelings within us. They are the interpretive lenses through which we look to make sense of life. They affect our beliefs, values, and actions, provide a sense of continuity and coherence, link past, present, and future, and give life an orderly and somewhat predictable structure.\n\nThrough metanarratives, we connect our individual experiences to a broader context, finding our place in the overarching story of life. They bridge the chasm between the personal and the universal, the known and the unknown, the actual and the possible. We would be lost in a world without metanarratives, adrift in a sea of disconnected experiences. They are, in essence, the compass that guides our way through the labyrinth of life, providing us with a sense of purpose and meaning.\n\nLife on this planet offers an overabundance of such narratives to choose from. However, only one of them cuts through the fog of confusion and provides answers that lead to a profound comprehension of truth. Only one shines a powerful light into the darkness of this world: the old and ongoing true story of the great controversy between God and Satan. This is the metanarrative we’ll be discussing in this lesson. It is the most cohesive, logical, and relevant story ever written, offering us clarity on the major issues of life. It answers big questions such as, “If God is good, why is there evil?”, “Will there ever be full and true justice?”, and “Does God even care?” Though the great controversy narrative has yet to draw to a close, we already know the ending, and—spoiler alert—it’s good. Jesus wins!\n\nIn this quarter, we will examine the biblical evidence that underpins this monumental conflict. We will navigate through various foundational themes and multiple key components that will paint for us a more complete picture of this cosmic war between good and evil. Both our exploration and the celestial conflict will unveil the true state of the character of God and the character of Satan.\n\nOur weekly studies will lead us into history, prophecy, and philosophy as well as biblical stories and passages that illustrate and reveal the great controversy metanarrative and its various dynamics, both in the seen and the unseen dimensions of reality. We will examine its relevancy to our daily lives with a renewed perspective and, by God’s grace, be encouraged to make decisions for Christ.\n\nBe prepared for attempts to deter and distract you from studying the Bible and these carefully assembled lessons. Do not yield. Immerse yourself in God’s Word and approach these lessons with steadfast prayer. Pray not only for your own understanding but also for others around the world engaged in this study, “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” (Eph. 6:12).\n\nAs an additional resource, the book The Great Controversy by Ellen G. White is highly recommended. It provides inspired insight into the themes of this study guide and is a must-read for every sincere believer. It’s available for free on egwwritings.org and through the “EGW Writings 2” app.\n\nIt is the author’s fervent hope and belief that delving into this topic with humility will cultivate a deeper love for God, a stronger identity in Jesus, and a resilient trust in God, even when facing trials, heartaches, and adversity on this side of heaven.",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day.

        "introduction": "### The Psalms: Where God and People Meet Heart to Heart\n\nThe Psalms are prayers and hymns of the Bible par excellence. Uttered in praise, joy, sorrow, and despair; spoken or sung in private and in public by laypeople, kings, poets, and priests; coming from both the righteous and repentant sinners, the Psalms have served as the prayer book and the hymnbook to generations of believers.\n\nThe book of Psalms owes its distinct role to the fact that while most of the Bible speaks to us, the Psalms speak for us and with us. The Psalms are a source of blessing, hope, and revival, a guide for both self-reflection and reflection on God’s greatness, liberating when one cries out of the depths, and captivating for a renewed surrender to God. It is thus not surprising that many people find the Psalms resonating with their emotions and experiences and adopt them as their own prayers. Luther poignantly speaks of the Psalms: “Where can one find nobler words to express joy than in the Psalms of praise or gratitude? In them you can see into the hearts of all the saints as if you were looking at a lovely pleasure-garden, or were gazing into heaven. . . . Or where can one find more profound, more penitent, more sorrowful words in which to express grief than in the Psalms of lamentation? In these, you see into the hearts of all the saints as if you were looking at death or gazing into hell, so dark and obscure is the scene rendered by the changing shadows of the wrath of God. . . . It is therefore easy to understand why the book of Psalms is the favourite book of all the saints. For every man on every occasion can find in it Psalms which fit his needs, which he feels to be as appropriate as if they had been set there just for his sake. In no other book can he find words to equal them, nor better words.”—Martin Luther, Martin Luther: Selections From His Writings, ed. John Dillenberger (New York: Anchor Books, 1962), pp. 39, 40.\n\nTo experience the life-transforming power of the Psalms, we are called to sing and pray them as did the generations of believers who have used the Psalms to pour out their praises, petitions, confessions, laments, and thanksgiving to the sovereign God of grace and justice.\n\nDo we need to study the Psalms, then? Like the rest of the Scriptures, the Psalms were written in their distinctive historical, theological, and literary contexts. The task of the study of the Psalms is to bring the particular world of the Psalms closer to the modern audience. We must note that while the Psalms are prayers of God’s people and even prayers that Jesus prayed as the incarnated Lord, the Psalms are also prayers about Jesus. They are God’s revelation to humanity. Another task of the study of the Psalms is, thus, to learn from the Psalms about all that God did, does, and will do for the world in and through Jesus Christ.\n\nAlthough the Psalms are a collection of 150 poems, the collection may not be as random as it appears. The Psalms bear witness to a spiritual journey that is common to many of God’s children. The journey begins with a faith that is firmly established and secured by God’s sovereign rule and where good gets rewarded and evil punished. As we progress through our study, we will see what happens when the well-ordered world of faith is challenged and threatened by evil. Does God still reign? How can believers sing the Lord’s song in a strange land?\n\nOur desire and prayer are that the Psalms strengthen us on our life journey, and through them we get to meet God daily, heart to heart, until the day when we see Jesus Christ face to face.\n\n_Dragoslava Santrac, PhD in Old Testament, is managing editor of the Encyclopedia of Seventh-day Adventists at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists world headquarters.

We can’t just listen to what Jesus asks of us—we are to do it (James 1:22) if we want to be effective agents of the kingdom on this earth.\n\nThe first lesson of each quarter covers a different section of Jesus’ sermon on the mount, which is “at once Christ’s inaugural address as king of the kingdom of grace and also the constitution of the kingdom” (The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 322).\n\nAfter the first lesson of each quarter the rest of the lessons are about the different challenges, rights, or privileges in the “real time” of being an agent of God’s kingdom.

Find out how other young people are facing the challenge of living for God in the real world.\n\n**How to use this bible study guide**\n\n**Step 1**: Notice that this Bible study guide isn’t meant to be read like a usual magazine or book. Each lesson comes out of the binding to be used as a separate sheet for study in advance during the week in preparation for Sabbath School. Be sure to take the right lesson to Sabbath School with you each week.\n\n**Step 2**: Use each week’s lesson in the way that is best for you. Each section has a day of the week listed beside it, but you may want to mix and match sections as you study. The sections work in any order.\n\n**Step 3**: Review the memory verse each day of the week.\n\n**Step 4**: Be prepared to share your thoughts and discoveries with your Sabbath School class.",

        "introduction": "### God's Grace Builds Community\n\n**Dear student,**\n\nYou are a gift from God, and He loves you very much! If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

In these lessons the children will be introduced to three major themes—service through following Jesus’ example; experiencing God’s grace by being part of His family; and worshipping by praising Jesus for what He has done for us.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.\n\nContact us through our Web site at www.gracelink.net. - Cordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### The Book of Psalms: Where God and His People Meet\n\nThe Book of Psalms is a collection of prayers and hymns. These prayers and hymns are also poems. They are the most beautiful poems ever written. The poems in the Book of Psalms talk about different human feelings and topics: praise, joy, sorrow, and suffering. These poems or songs were read or sung in public or private. Who read or sang them? Kings, poets, and priests or spiritual leaders sang them. So did sinners who confessed their sins and gave their lives back to God. People the same as you and me sang or read these songs and poems, too. God’s people have used the Book of Psalms for their prayers and songs since Old Testament times.\n\nThe Book of Psalms talks **to** us. But more than that, the Book of Psalms also talks for us and with us. God pours out a blessing on His people from the Book of Psalms. The Book of Psalms gives us hope. Its poems give us new life in the Lord. The Book of Psalms also is a guidebook that teaches us to understand ourselves and God’s royal beauty. The Book of Psalms helps us give God our sad and painful feelings. The Book of Psalms leads us to God and helps us want to give our lives fully to Him. We should not be surprised to learn that many people feel that the Book of Psalms talks about their personal experiences and feelings. That’s why people make the poems in the Book of Psalms their own prayers.\n\nMartin Luther says these words about the Book of Psalms: “Where can we find words as beautiful as in the Book of Psalms? These poems of praise and thanks communicate our joy better than any other words. In these poems, you can look into the hearts of the poets as if you were looking at a lovely garden or were looking at heaven. . . . Or where can we find better words to communicate that we are sad and suffering? In the Book of Psalms, you see into the hearts of the poets the same as if you looked at death, face-to-face, or into hell itself. . . . So, it’s easy to understand why the Book of Psalms is the favorite book of all God’s people. People everywhere can find a poem or song in the Book of Psalms to fit their needs.When we find the poem we need, we feel that the poem was written just for us. No other book can match the Book of Psalms. Psalms explains our feelings better than any other book of the Bible.” —Martin Luther, _Martin Luther: Selections From His Writings_, editor, John Dillenberger (New York: Anchor Books, 1962), pages 39, 40, adapted.\n\nDo you want to have a life-changing experience when you read the Book of Psalms? If yes, then you also must sing and pray the songs and poems in the Book of Psalms. The Israelites sang and prayed these songs and poems in Bible times. Ever since that time, God’s people have used the poems and songs in the Book of Psalms to praise God, pray, confess their sins, cry to the Lord, and give Him thanks. We should do these things because the Lord is all-powerful. We should praise Him because He is fair in everything He does. We should thank Him for His mercy and love.\n\nSo, we know we need to sing and pray the songs and poems in the Book of Psalms. But do we need to **study** these songs and poems, too? In short, yes. First, we must understand that the poems and songs in the Book of Psalms were written at different times and places. Second, these poems and songs teach different messages and lessons about God. When we study the Book of Psalms, we want to help the reader understand the poets and their lives better. Then we can start to understand their songs and poems better, too.\n\nSo, we know that the poems and songs in the Book of Psalms are the prayers of God’s people. Did you also know that Jesus prayed many of these poems and songs, too, when He was on earth? The poems and songs in the Book of Psalms are also **about** Jesus. In the Book of Psalms, God shows us Jesus and tells us about Him. When we study the Book of Psalms, we want to learn about the things that God did in the past, does today, and will do for us in the future.\n\nThe Book of Psalms is a collection of 150 poems. These poems help us understand our spiritual journey in life. Our journey starts with faith. Our faith grows as we understand that God is our King. The whole earth and everything that happens is under His full control. Our all-powerful God rewards our good behavior. He punishes evil. We must remember this Bible truth when times are hard, and we suffer for our faith. As we continue our study in the Book of Psalms this quarter, we will see what happens when sin and evil people attack the faith of God’s people. When that happens, we may ask, with the poets in the Book of Psalms, “Is God in control? How can God’s people sing God’s praises in a land where evil people are trying to hurt us?”\n\nOur hope is that the Book of Psalms will help answer these difficult questions. We also hope our study will help us grow strong during our life journey. May we meet with God daily, heart to heart, in the Book of Psalms until that day when we see Jesus face-to-face.\n\n_Dragoslava Santrac has a PhD in Old Testament studies.

        "introduction": "### Jesus and Liberty\n\nA few months ago, I participated in a small interfaith panel that discussed religious liberty. At this event, I sat between a Buddhist teacher and a Roman Catholic priest—people whose beliefs are very different from my own. I was glad to have the opportunity to share a few Seventh-day Adventist perspectives on religious liberty with this diverse audience. My comments at this table touched on four topics:\n\n1\\. The church needs to follow Jesus’ example of winning with love and influence rather than fighting with weapons of force and power (John 18:36).\n\n2\\. There is a temptation for government agencies to lower the priority of religious liberties. For example, one of those agencies recently blocked a Christian couple from adopting their own granddaughter because they wouldn’t agree to support gender transitioning therapies if she requested them before adulthood. This couple’s deep conviction regarding the protection of their granddaughter’s sexual health was enough for the government agency to deny them custody (see www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0yhbikRRuI).\n\n3\\. Adventism strongly adheres to the doctrine of separation of church and state, following the tradition of Baptist pastor Roger Williams, who was an early pioneer of religious liberty in America. Williams advocated that the government and its laws must not interfere in our relationship with God as defined in the first four commandments (Ex. 20:3–11; Matt. 22:37, 38). Williams believed the government’s role should be limited to the last six commandments, which deal with civility in neighbor-to-neighbor relationships (Ex. 20:12–17; Matt. 22:39). Adventists have a strong history of advocating for separation of church and state.\n\n4\\. Christians around the world are likely feeling hurt and angry after suffering the shutdowns and subsequent isolation caused by COVID-19. In places where churches were closed while casinos and taverns were remained open, one can see why Christians may feel pressed or even attacked by secularism. However, we must also guard against Christians who overreact to an imbalance in the political equilibrium. This can eventually result in religious tyranny, which is just as bad or even worse than secular tyranny. In the past two thousand years, more lives have been lost to religious zeal than secular despotism.\n\nThis panel was the first of its kind in our local area. People in many places are becoming more concerned about the increasing threats to religious liberty, hence the growing number of similar events across various organizations and churches. Young adults today can expect this to be a trending topic of interest in the coming years.\n\nThe Adventist understanding of biblical prophecy leads us to believe that religious liberty will become a central matter of popular debate and public interest. If religious liberty is indeed a looming crisis, it would behoove all believers to equip themselves with biblical perspectives on this important topic. Ellen White urges, “We should endeavor to disarm prejudice by placing ourselves in a proper light before the people. We should bring before them the real question at issue, thus interposing the most effectual protest against measures to restrict liberty of conscience. We should search the Scriptures and be able to give the reason for our faith” (_Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5_ [1885], 452).\n\nReligious liberty should never be relegated to mere philosophy, or legal jargon; it’s a biblical issue that impacts people in every culture and in every part of the world. To neglect this topic is to neglect the Adventist mission and message. “The banner of truth and religious liberty held aloft by the founders of the gospel church and by God's witnesses during the centuries that have passed since then, has, in this last conflict, been committed to our hands. The responsibility for this great gift rests with those whom God has blessed with a knowledge of His word” (Ellen White, _Acts of the Apostles_ [1911], 68, 69).\n\nThis quarter’s study explores biblical principles that can equip every person to better understand Jesus and liberty. The first several chapters close examine Jesus’ life, for Jesus is central to our understanding of religious liberty. One chapter examines how Paul’s life demonstrated Jesus’ principles, and the remaining few chapters cover the implications of biblical prophecy and how extending freedom helps prepare us for the Second Coming.\n\nEach chapter begins with a story from history, moving from the early church in Rome to the Protestant Reformation in Europe to the origins of Adventism in North America. These stories illustrate the challenges that people around the world face still today. May this study draw you closer to Christ and better prepare you to be His representative wherever God has placed you!\n\n_Joe Reeves, Editor_",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day.

        "introduction": "### Quit Talking and Start Doing Something!\n\nYears ago, one of our Adventist magazines published a parable about a dreadful swamp. As people passed along the path going through it, they were often overcome and fell in. Their dying cries could be heard all through the nearby village. It was terrible.\n\nThe people held a village council. In fact, they held many village councils. Various theories and papers were presented analyzing the cause and sometimes even proposing solutions. But nothing was ever done except to continue meeting and talking. Over the years, the discussions continued. People wrote dissertations on the topic. Guest lecturers were brought in. Yard sales were held to raise money so that meals could be provided to those who sacrificed so many hours sitting in these meetings. Eventually, money was raised to build a soundproof meeting room so that the cries of the lost and dying would not disrupt the ongoing discussions. But nobody did anything to help those who were in trouble. And nobody did anything to try to stop more people from being lost in the swamp. They just talked.\n\nThe church as a whole and your Sabbath School class in particular don’t want to be like the people in that village. We love our time together to pray, think, share, and discuss. But we long to go beyond this and actually do something for and with those around us. We want to make a difference in our communities and around the world. We want the work to be finished, and we want Jesus to return.\n\nThis quarter’s Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is designed to focus attention on getting out there and doing something. We will examine many wonderful Bible stories. We will read about exciting experiences and illustrations. We will learn about available resources to assist us in reaching out to our neighbors (especially to those who have no Christian background). But those will just be ways of illustrating and motivating us. The real focus, the real heart of each lesson, is what will be shared on Thursday each week—a challenge to get out and, actually, do something.\n\nWe will share theological insights and provide tools and ideas for you to work with. And each Thursday’s portion of the lesson will issue a careful progression of challenges. It will begin easy. And as the quarter goes along, there will be subtle (and not so subtle) increases in the challenge. The goal is for each of us to take the challenge, pray for the Holy Spirit to guide us, and then spend a few minutes in the next week discussing how it went. This isn’t to be a time of boasting, but a time of sharing—both about what went well and what didn’t. As we share, the group will generate ideas. Prayer lists will grow (personal and collective).\n\nIn the end, it is our desire that this quarter be remembered not for memorable thoughts, engaging stories, or deep theological concepts. These may be there—lots of them. But it is our desire that we will all look back on this quarter as the time when the Holy Spirit took our humble efforts and worked mission miracles for the honor and glory of His name.\n\n_The Global Mission Centers were first established by the General Conference in 1980. They operate under the direction of the General Conference Office of Adventist Mission. There are currently six centers. Their purpose is to help the church more effectively start new groups of believers among the major non-Christian people groups of the world._\n\n_At the time of this writing, the directors of these centers (Petras Bahadur, Richard Elofer, Kleber Gonçalves, Clifmond Shameerudeen, Doug Venn, Amy Whitsett, Greg Whitsett), assisted by Homer Trecartin (Global Mission Centers director), and Jeff Scoggins (Global Mission Planning director), collectively authored this Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide.

There is a battle going on between God’s kingdom and the kingdom of evil. Being agents of God’s kingdom requires action. We can’t just listen to what Jesus asks of us—we are to do it (James 1:22) if we want to be effective agents of the kingdom on this earth.\n\nThe first lesson of each quarter covers a different section of Jesus’ sermon on the mount, which is “at once Christ’s inaugural address as king of the kingdom of grace and also the constitution of the kingdom” (The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 322).\n\nAfter the first lesson of each quarter the rest of the lessons are about the different challenges, rights, or privileges in the “real time” of being an agent of God’s kingdom. A Christian never knows what he or she will be encountering next.\n\nRemember to go to http://guidemagazine.org/rtf and explore each week’s topic with other e-teens. Find out how other young people are facing the challenge of living for God in the real world.\n\n**How to use this bible study guide**\n\n**Step 1**: Notice that this Bible study guide isn’t meant to be read like a usual magazine or book. Each lesson comes out of the binding to be used as a separate sheet for study in advance during the week in preparation for Sabbath School. Be sure to take the right lesson to Sabbath School with you each week.\n\n**Step 2**: Use each week’s lesson in the way that is best for you. Each section has a day of the week listed beside it, but you may want to mix and match sections as you study. The sections work in any order.\n\n**Step 3**: Review the memory verse each day of the week.\n\n**Step 4**: Be prepared to share your thoughts and discoveries with your Sabbath School class.",

        "introduction": "### God's Grace Builds Community\n\n**Dear student,**\n\nYou are a gift from God, and He loves you very much! If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

        "introduction": "### Dear parents,\n\nIn this issue of the Kindergarten Bible Study Guide you will find that the lessons are from the life of Jesus. In these lessons the children will be introduced to three major themes—service through following Jesus’ example; experiencing God’s grace by being part of His family; and worshipping by praising Jesus for what He has done for us.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.\n\nContact us through our Web site at www.gracelink.net. - Cordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### Quit Talking and Do Something!\n\nYears ago, one of our Adventist magazines printed a picture story about a stinky swamp. A walking path went through the middle of the swamp. People who walked on the path complained about the terrible smell. Sometimes the smell was so awful that people on the path fainted and fell in. Villagers who lived near the swamp heard the cries of the people as they fell in and died.\n\nSo, the villagers held a meeting to solve the swamp problem. The villagers had many meetings. Experts shared their ideas about the cause of the problem. A few people suggested possible ways to solve the problem. But no one did anything to fix the problem. The people continued to meet and talk. For many years, the talks continued. People wrote important papers about the topic. Guest speakers came to the village and talked about the swamp. The villagers held yard sales to make money to pay for meals for the people who spent so much time sitting in the meetings talking about the swamp. After a while, the villagers collected enough money to build a special room so that the people in the meetings wouldn’t be bothered by the cries of the lost and dying when they fell in the swamp. But no one did anything to help the people in trouble. No one did anything to stop more people from getting lost in the swamp. The people only talked.\n\nFor sure, the Seventh-day Adventist Church and your Sabbath School class don’t want to behave the same as the people in that village. We love our time together to pray, think, share, and talk. At the same time, we want to do more. We want to help the people around us. We want to make our communities better. We want to make life on this earth better for people, too. We want to finish God’s work so that Jesus can come back.\n\nThis quarter’s Bible study guide helps us to get out and do something for the people around us. In our study, we will read about the exciting experiences of people who work for God. We will learn about ideas that can help us to share Bible truth with our neighbors. We will learn how to share Jesus with non-Christian people who may not know anything about Him at all. These ideas will help us do our work for God. Each week, in Thursday’s study, we will share with you two tasks. These tasks will help you to get out in your neighborhood or community and start doing something to win people to Jesus. We will share Bible truth and give you learning tools and ideas to help you. We also\n\nwill encourage you to pray for the Holy Spirit to lead you and help you use what you learn. Spend a few minutes each week talking with your class members. Talk about how things went. What worked? What didn’t? What did you learn? Remember, this time is not about bragging about all the wonderful work you did. Make this time about sharing. As you share your ideas and experiences with each other, your Sabbath school group will come up with new ideas. Prayer lists will grow (both your personal list and the group’s list).\n\nFinally, we hope that you will remember this quarter’s study as a time when the Holy Spirit blessed your efforts and worked miracles for the honor of Jesus and His Name.\n\nThe General Conference first started Global Mission Centers in 1980 to help share the Good News about Jesus with people everywhere. The Global Mission Centers are under the control of the General Conference Office of Adventist Mission. At this time, there are six centers. Their job is to help the church start new groups of Christians among non-Christian people groups on the earth.\n\n_The managers for the six worldwide mission centers wrote this guide.These managers are Petras Bahadur, Richard Elofer, Kleber Gonçalves, Clifmond Shameerudeen, Doug Venn, and Gregg Whitsett. Gary Krause, Homer Trecartin, and Jeff Scoggins also helped write the guide. (Gary is the manager for Adventist Mission. Homer is the retired manager for Global Mission Centers, and Jeff is the planning manager for Global Mission.)_",

        "introduction": "### Adventist Heritage: Our Identity, Mission, and Message\n\nIn recent years, people have become interested in tracing their biological roots. Multibillion dollar companies have sprung up to meet the growing demand, offering quick and easy do-it-yourself DNA tests that allow people to discover what percentage of their DNA is Chinese, Northern European, Southern African, or Native American, to name just a few examples. Perhaps we’ve become so interested in our history because knowing our past has an impact on our present and future. It offers us a sense of cultural identity. Similarly, understanding our church history gives us a sense of purpose and mission both in the present moving forward. The past, present, and future cannot be separated.\n\nThe history of our church is a beautiful story that speaks to God’s goodness. The Seventh-day Adventist Church stands on the shoulders of spiritual giants, tracing its heritage beyond the Millerite movement all the way back to the Protestant Reformation. Our church formed in the mid-to-late 1800s, and while it was founded in the United States of America, it spread to all inhabited continents of the world within thirty or forty years. Shaped and driven by Scripture, the mission and identity of our church led to a global movement that planted churches, publishing houses, hospitals, and schools all around the world.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive study on our church’s history, but it will introduce the major characters and events as they relate to what we believe as a church and who we are. It is a humble history, but hopefully one you can relate to. Unlike the Reformation, which was led by academics, linguists, and scholars, the Advent movement was shaped by farmers, soap makers, sea captains, and young men and women with very little formal education. The average age of these early pioneers was somewhere in the mid-20s. It was a young church led by young people, almost like a start-up company full of youthful ideas and energy, a big vision, and a desire to change the world. First and foremost was a desire to correctly understand the Word of God and to be faithful to the Bible. Today, God is still searching for willing people, young and old, whose hearts are loyal to Him first. Never let age prevent you from answering God’s call. It’s still true that “The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him” (2 Chron. 16:9). May our pioneers’ youthfulness inspire us to embrace the responsibilities of God’s work early in life.\n\nIt’s important to remember that our pioneers were mortal, fallible people who made mistakes—some of them even fell away from the faith they once professed. The history of Adventist pioneers shows that the process of discovering truth can be slow, protracted, controversial, and even painful. Some of the major doctrines and teachings in God’s Word were not discovered for years or even decades. However, God was as concerned about the journey of discovering truth as He was about the ultimate destination. He waited patiently while His people were wrong, knowing that following the right process—that reaching the conclusion the right way—is the most important thing. We will see this illustrated in several of our lessons this quarter, which explores various periods of our church history and the doctrinal truths that were discovered in each. It also looks at how each of these truths impacted the church in a practical manner. In each chapter, we will study the key truths that were discovered, the major people involved, the arguments they grappled with, and the primary biblical texts they studied.\n\nThis inVerse quarter is supplemented by a special resource that can help personal studies, Sabbath School groups, or small-group Bible studies come alive. Most chapters include short documentary videos produced by the principal contributor, Adam Ramdin, that document the key stories. These videos are recorded on location, where the events happened, to help viewers better visualize our pioneers’ stories. These videos can be accessed by following the links in each lesson’s inTro or by visiting www.lineagejourney.com and navigating to Season 2. We pray that this study and these resources will help you discover your spiritual heritage and enrich your relationship with Jesus.",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nCordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### Ephesians: How to Follow Jesus in Trying Times\n\nIn the Epistle to the Ephesians, Paul tells us about the Ephesians themselves. Years after the exciting events of the early days of Christian mission in Ephesus, the Ephesians struggled with the significance of their Christian faith.\n\nPaul, once the troubler of the economy of this fourth-largest city in the Roman Empire, is now sidelined and imprisoned. Writing from prison, he worries that the believers in Ephesus may “lose heart,” forgetting any active sense of what it means to be disciples of Jesus in the sophisticated, urban, and thoroughly pagan culture of Ephesus. Though his hearers are already Christians, Paul’s tone is one of recruitment. He seeks to reenlist them in the Christian faith, to reignite the fire of their devotion to Christ, and to resurrect the excitement of being part of God’s great enterprise in the world, the church.\n\nBecause the Christian faith is all about Christ, Paul radiates admiration and worship of Him. If wobbly Christian disciples are to regain their footing, it will be because they recapture their first love for Jesus and establish fresh trust in His grace and power. So, Paul highlights Christ’s exaltation in heaven above all the powers and deities that seek to attract the devotion of believers in Ephesus. Jesus is the goal of the divine plan for the ages, a plan in which believers, as the church, play an important role in God’s plans to unify all things in Christ.\n\nAs Paul seeks to draw believers in Ephesus into fresh devotion to their Lord, he does not dumb down the demands of Christian discipleship. He spells out in some detail what Christian behavior and community look like. Christians are called to Spirit-inspired, Christ-honoring, God-directed worship, which Paul illustrates again and again. A devotion to Christ impacts how one acts and speaks. To love Christ means to respect and value fellow believers. It means resisting the patterns of mean-spirited and sexually decadent behavior so rampant in their culture. It means, in our relationships within church and household, borrowing from the example of self-sacrifice offered by Christ. It means offering fellow citizens of Ephesus clear examples of a new pattern of human existence.\n\nPaul spends a good deal of his letter expressing his excitement for this new pattern of what it means to be human through membership in God’s church. He is especially invigorated by the thought that God has joined estranged segments of humanity—Jews and Gentiles—as one in the church. In living out unity where hostility would be expected, they have an opportunity to exhibit the characteristics of God’s new society and the coming kingdom.\n\nIn pursuing the importance of being part of God’s church, Paul develops four metaphors for the church. Believers make up the body of Christ, demonstrating their devotion to Christ and their unity with each other. They are a living temple, built through the sacrifice of Christ on Calvary, in which God is worshiped. They are the bride of Christ, who look toward a grand marriage ceremony when the Bridegroom comes to claim them as His own. In a final metaphor that expresses Paul’s efforts to reenlist them in Christian faith, they are the army of Christ, which wages peace in His name, combating the forces of darkness in God’s strength as they look toward Christ’s return.\n\nEphesians, then, speaks especially to times like our own, in which the allure of the world and the passing of time threaten to dull Christian discipleship. It lifts up Christ and accents the significance of following Him as engaged, active members of His church as we live out the hope of His return. This quarter we have the privilege of listening prayerfully to Ephesians and experiencing anew the excitement of following Jesus in challenging times.\n\n_John K.

If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

        "introduction": "### Dear parents,\n\nIn this issue of the Kindergarten Bible Study Guide you will find that the lessons are from the life of Jesus. In these lessons the children will be introduced to three major themes—service through following Jesus’ example; experiencing God’s grace by being part of His family; and worshipping by praising Jesus for what He has done for us.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.\n\nContact us through our Web site at www.gracelink.net. - Cordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### Ephesians: How to Follow Jesus When Times Are Hard\n\nIn the letter to the Ephesians, Paul tells us about the experience of the Ephesian Christians. Paul writes to the Ephesians many years after the Christian religion came to the city of Ephesus. When Paul writes his letter to the Ephesians, they are in trouble. Many of them wonder if their faith is important to their lives in Ephesus.\n\nEphesus was the fourth largest city in the Kingdom of Rome at the time Paul wrote his letter. In the past, Paul’s preaching made many businessmen in Ephesus upset. The businessmen made and sold statues of Diana, the goddess of the moon. The businessmen felt that Paul’s preaching was bad for business. They were afraid that people would become Christians and stop buying the statues of Diana. Now many years after that experience, Paul writes to the Ephesians from jail. Paul worries that the Ephesian Christians will lose hope because they live in a city where most people worship false gods. Paul’s readers are already Christian. But Paul talks to them the same way a general talks to people that he wants to convince to join his army. Paul wants His readers to join God’s army again. Paul wants to help his readers feel excited again about serving Jesus. Then we will feel excited because we are a part of God’s church.\n\nThe Christian faith is all about Jesus. So, Paul talks about Jesus in his letter to the Ephesians. Paul’s letter is filled with respect and worship for God. Weak Christians will grow strong if they fall in love with Jesus all over again. Christians must trust in God’s mercy and His power over sin. Paul wants to help his readers to do that. So, Paul talks about the honor that Jesus got when He woke up from the dead and went to heaven. God’s plan to save sinners is all about Jesus, too. As part of this plan, God wants to join everything in heaven and on earth in peace and agreement. God wants to put everything under Jesus’ control, too. The church has an important part in this work.\n\nPaul explains to the Ephesian Christians more about God’s plan for His church. God offers a new way of life for Christians. If Christians want this new life, they must let God change their behavior and help them live holy lives. Jesus’ love for us will change how we behave and communicate. When we belong to Jesus, we must not act mean and nasty to other people. We will not use people for sex or do sex sins. What if the people around us are doing these sins and say they are okay to do? We will behave the same as Jesus. Jesus is our Example, and not the people around us. Jesus suffered and gave His life for us. So, because of Jesus’ offering for us, we will love our friends, family, and church members. We will serve everyone with joy. God’s plan for His church also includes fellowship with Him and with other members. Paul invites Christians to worship God, accept the Holy Spirit, and honor Jesus.\n\nPaul talks a lot in his letter about how our lives will change when we belong to God’s church. Paul is very excited about the idea that God has joined together two groups who were separated in the past: Jews and non-Jews. God joins these two groups together as one people in His church. The church shows God’s love to the people on this earth. The church also shows to them the important rules of God’s coming kingdom.\n\nPaul uses four word pictures for the church:\n\n**1.  Body.** Christians are part of Jesus’ body. As part of Jesus’ body, the church members show other people their love for Jesus and their loyalty to Him. Church members also show their peace and agreement with each other.\n\n**2.  Temple.** The church is a living temple. Jesus built this temple when He died on the cross at Calvary. We worship God in this temple, the church.\n\n**3.  Bride.** The church is Jesus’ bride. Jesus is the Groom. The same as Jesus’ bride, the church looks forward to the time when the Groom will come to take His people home to live with Him forever. That happy time will feel the same as a wedding.\n\n**4.  Army.** The church is the same as God’s army. As soldiers in God’s army, Christians fight hard in Jesus’ name to bring peace to the hearts of people. Church members fight in God’s strength against Satan and his evil angels.\n\nEphesians has an important message that we need for our time today. As time passes, we may become lazy or too relaxed in our worship of God. Paul’s letter to the Ephesians helps us to remember to look to Jesus for new life. As Christians, we must do more for Jesus than just showing up for church. We must work for Jesus while we wait for Him to come back. This quarter we will prayerfully and carefully study the letter to the Ephesians. May we get excited again about following Jesus in these difficult times.\n\n_John K.

        "introduction": "### The Book of Leviticus\n\nRecently, I shared with a friend that I was writing the inVerse lessons on the book of Leviticus. I told him I was really enjoying the study. He smiled and said, “That’s good, but why not just skip it and read the New Testament? Doesn’t it all point to Jesus anyway?” As I thought about his comments, I was quite impressed. My friend, who may have never read the book of Leviticus, understood correctly that the book points unapologetically to Jesus. In fact, every book in the Bible does! Leviticus is like a gospel puzzle book—the more you read it, the better you get at seeing Jesus and understanding the depth of the plan of salvation. If that isn’t motivation enough to study Leviticus, here are six other important aspects of this Pentateuchal book.\n\nFirst, when we read the book of Leviticus, we gain greater insight into why Jesus and others said and did certain things in the New Testament. For example, what did Jesus mean when He warned that “no one comes to the Father except through Me” (John 14:6)? And what did John the Baptist mean when He said, “Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29)? This book will deepen your understanding of Scripture—especially of the New Testament. It will cause Jesus’ words and actions to come alive in a new way as you understand them in the context found in Leviticus.\n\nSecond, the book of Leviticus helps us identify Jesus as the promised Messiah and Savior of the world (Lev. 1–7). Had the Jews who lived in the New Testament times really understood this book, they might have received Jesus instead of rejecting Him. They might have understood His mission as a suffering Savior, not a conquering king. They might have grasped that His claims to be sinless (John 8:46) and to “always do those things that please Him [the Father]” (John 8:29) qualified Him to be their Messiah and Savior rather than precluded Him from it. Incredibly, it was the rituals taught in the book of Leviticus that awakened Jesus to His role as Savior of the world when as a child He visited the temple (Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages [Mountain View, Calif.: Pacific Press Pub. Assn., 1898, 1940], p. 78).\n\nThird, the book of Leviticus teaches us what God expects from His people by way of obedience. In the book of Exodus, God gave His people the Ten Commandments, but in Leviticus, He expanded on the law in practical ways. Leviticus speaks to our modern culture and helps us better understand the Christian’s role in promoting health, purity, and justice; protecting the weak; helping the poor; and loving the immigrant (Lev. 11–27). In more succinct words, the book teaches practical Christianity, which is based on love and deep respect for God.\n\nFourth, the book of Leviticus is prophetic in that it points not only to Jesus’ coming and death on the cross but also to His ministry as our high priest in the heavenly sanctuary, the end of sin, and Satan’s final demise. This amazing book predicts the investigative judgment, the first and second comings of Jesus, and the restoration of all things—when the earth will be made brand-new (Lev. 16; 23).\n\nFifth, the book of Leviticus is like an autostereogram; it’s a two-dimensional picture that, when you stare at it intensely, reveals a three-dimensional picture hidden within. The more you study Leviticus, the more Jesus and the good news of the gospel will jump out at you in every chapter. From my own study I’ve found that Jesus is everywhere in this book. It has stories, as Genesis and Exodus do (e.g., Lev. 10, 24), but it mostly communicates the gospel through rituals, symbols, laws, and regulations.\n\nFinally, the sixth reason we must study the book of Leviticus is that it affirms the unique calling God has given us as Seventh-day Adventists. This book affirms our teachings regarding the Sabbath, the Second Coming, spiritual gifts, the “holy priesthood” of believers (1 Peter 2:5), Christ’s work of atonement and investigation in the heavenly sanctuary, our commitment to a healthy lifestyle, and ultimately our confidence in salvation through the blood of Christ. Leviticus encourages Adventists to keep moving forward, to never give up, and to boldly tell the world what an amazing friend we’ve found in Jesus.\n\nMost likely Leviticus may not be in your list of top 10 books of the Bible to read. In fact, some of you may be experts in Genesis and Exodus simply because you can’t seem to get through Leviticus and on to the other books. However, I hope and pray that this lesson study changes that for you. Leviticus is a wonderful book that contains many deep concepts, especially regarding what God values. These are things we can understand only when we compare scripture to scripture, guided by the Holy Spirit (John 16:13; 14:26; 1 Cor. 2:13; 14).\n\nThis book is divided into 14 lessons, each of which reveals a variety of God’s values that He wants His people to embrace as well. Each value reveals something beautiful about God’s heart and encourages action on behalf of His people. I challenge you to read this book humbly and prayerfully over the next 14 weeks and let the Holy Spirit lead and challenge you.\n\n_Gary Blanchard_",

Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nCordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### The Three Angels’ Messages\n\nOn October 15, 1844, one week before the Great Disappointment, a boy had been born into a pious Lutheran family in Germany. His name was Friedrich Nietzsche, who would become one of modernity’s most influential atheists. Believing that the Christian God was dying in the West, Nietzsche railed against the Christian religion’s continued moral influence, deriding it as a “slave morality,” the morality of the weak who, in an attempt to protect themselves from the stronger, concocted such silly notions as “Love your enemies.” For Nietzsche, modernity needed to get beyond antiquated notions of “good and evil”; a character in one of his books (Thus Spoke Zarathustra) declared, “Break . . .  the old tablets!” (meaning, of course, the Ten Commandments).\n\nThe year 1844 was also important for Karl Marx, the founder of Communism. Called the “Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844,” this work had been written by Marx that year, even if not published until 1932 by the Soviet Union. The manuscripts show the early development of Marx’s ideology in which he argued for a totally materialistic reality that moved through various economic stages until the workers of the world would unite, overthrow their capitalist oppressors, and create a utopia on earth.\n\nThe year 1844 had been an important one for Charles Darwin, too. In what has become known as the “Essay of 1844,” Darwin produced one of the earliest expressions of his evolutionary theory, even if it was not then made public. Only in 1859, with the publication of On the Origin of Species, did Darwin publicly promulgate his view that all life on earth originated from a common ancestor by natural and chance processes alone.\n\nThe year 1844 was, however, the fulfillment of the 2,300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14, and the same year that, out of the leftovers of the Great Disappointment, seeds were planted that would burgeon into a worldwide movement whose core message repudiated the guts of Marxist, Nietzschean, and Darwinian ideology.\n\nContra Marx, the Seventh-day Adventist movement proclaimed that the great controversy between Christ and Satan, not a materialistic flow of history, explained world history that would end, not in a human–made Communist utopia but in the supernatural establishment of God’s eternal kingdom.\n\nContra Darwin, the Seventh-day Adventist movement taught that life originated, not in the natural and chance process of random mutation and natural selection but by the power of the Creator God, who in six days created life on earth and rested on the seventh.\n\nAnd contra Nietzsche, the Seventh-day Adventist movement proclaimed not only that God exists but that His universal code of morality (the “old tablets”), the Ten Commandments, remains God’s ultimate standard of judgment and binding on all humanity.\n\nA coincidence that all these events happened in 1844? One should not think so.\n\nMarx, Nietzsche, and Darwin are three influential figures whose work has caused humanity irreparable harm. But amid all these errors, God did not leave the world without a witness to His truth, which is why, amid these destructive ideologies, He raised up a movement that would, over time, morph into the Seventh-day Adventist Church and that would proclaim His last-day truth to the world—the three angels’ messages. These are messages that, at their core, refute the errors and misconceptions promoted by those three terribly deceived men.\n\nThe three angels’ messages are, in a sense, the marching orders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. And at their core, they are the gospel, pure and simple, but the gospel presented in the context of “present truth” (2 Pet. 1:12, NKJV).\n\nAnd this, the three angels’ messages, is our study for the quarter.\n\nA native of Connecticut, USA, Mark Finley, an internationally known evangelist, was a vice president at the General Conference from 2005 to 2010. After retiring from full-time employment, he became an assistant to the president of the General Conference. Pastor Finley and his wife, Ernestine, have three children and five grandchildren.",

        "introduction": "### God's Grace Builds Community\n\n**Dear student,**\n\nYou are a gift from God, and He loves you very much! If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child.

        "introduction": "### The Three Angels’ Messages\n\nThe first Adventists believed that Jesus was coming back to earth on October 22,1844. But Jesus didn’t come back. Many people felt sad when that happened. So, this time was named the Great Disappointment of 1844. This name means a time of deep sadness.\n      \nOn October 15, 1844, a boy was born to a religious Lutheran family in Germany. The boy was born one week before the Great Disappointment. The boy’s name was Friedrich Nietzsche. He would grow up to become one of the most powerful atheists in modern times. An atheist is someone who doesn’t believe in God. Nietzsche believed that the Christian God was dead. So, Nietzsche attacked the Christian religion. Nietzsche said that Christian teachings turned people into slaves. He believed Bible truth made people weak. He thought that the Bible teaching “love your enemies” was a silly idea. Nietzsche believed that modern people needed to throw out Christian ideas about “good and evil.” He said that these ideas were out-of-date and old fashioned. Nietzsche wrote books about his ideas against Christianity. One of his books was named Thus Spake Zarathustra. One of the characters in this book announces, “Smash the old law tablets!” (By tablets he means the Ten Commandments.)\n\nThe year 1844 also was important for a man named Karl Marx. Marx started communism. Communism is the belief about how a government should run and manage a country. This belief includes the idea that no one is better or more important than anyone else. In a Communist country, workers control how things are made. In 1844, Karl Marx wrote “Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844.” The Soviet Union printed Marx’s writings in 1932. The writings show Marx’s ideas. He said that the workers all over the earth will join together in the future and take control away from their government leaders. Then the workers will start a perfect community on earth. The year 1844 also is important for Charles Darwin. Darwin wrote an article that is now named the “Essay of 1844.” In this essay, Darwin talks about his idea named evolution. Evolution is a false teaching that says that life on earth started because of slow changes in plants and animals that happened over a very long time.\n\nThe year 1844 also was the time when the 2,300-day time message in Daniel 8:14 happened. That time also was named the Great Disappointment. Soon after the Great Disappointment, God started a new church. This church became the Seventh-day Adventist Church. God gave this worldwide church an important message. This message rejected the teachings of Nietzsche, Marx, and Darwin.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist religion teaches how the history on this earth will end. History will not end as Marx says it will. Remember, Marx said history will end when workers join together and take control away from their leaders. Then the workers will build a man-made community that is perfect. Adventists teach that this idea is false. History will end when God starts His everlasting kingdom.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist religion also teaches that life started when God made the skies and the earth in six days. So, life didn’t start with evolution, as Darwin says.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church announces that God is not dead. There is a living God, for sure. This God has a law that teaches everyone right from wrong. This law is the Ten Commandments. God will use this law to judge all humans who ever lived.\n\nSo, as we saw already, Nietzsche was born in 1844, and Marx and Darwin wrote many of their important ideas in 1844. Isn’t it interesting that the year 1844 is important in the lives of all three of these famous thinkers? Do you think it was only luck that these men were born or wrote important works in the same year that God started the Seventh-day Adventist Church? Careful, we should not think so.\n\nFor sure, Nietzsche, Marx, and Darwin all are very powerful thinkers. Sad to say, their writings and teachings have hurt many people. But God gave us hope and Bible truth. He started a church that became a worldwide church. This church must announce God’s end-time message to everyone on earth. This announcement is named the Three Angels’ Messages. These messages reject the false ideas that Nietzsche, Marx, and Darwin taught.\n\nThe Three Angels’ Messages show the members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church the work that God wants them to do. The Three Angels’ Messages show us the Good News that Jesus saves us from sin. The Three Angels’ Messages are “present truth” for our time (2 Peter 1:12, NKJV). Present truth is the Bible truth we need most for the time we live in today.\n\nThis quarter we will study the Three Angels’ Messages.\n\n_Mark Finley was born in the state of Connecticut in the United States of America. He has preached in many different countries worldwide. He worked as a top leader at the General Conference from 2005 to 2010. The General Conference is the headquarters for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. After Pastor Finley retired from full-time work, he worked part-time for the president of the General Conference. Pastor Finley and his wife, Ernestine, have three children and five grandchildren._",

His name was Friedrich Nietzsche, and he would become one of modernity’s most influential atheists. Believing that the Christian God was dying in the West, Nietzsche railed against the Christian religion’s continued moral influence, deriding it as a “slave morality”—the morality of the weak, who, in an attempt to protect themselves from the stronger, concocted silly notions such as “love your enemies.” For Nietzsche, modernity needed to get beyond antiquated notions of “good and evil,” exemplified by a character in one of his books (Thus Spake Zarathustra) who declared, “Smash the old law tablets!” (meaning, of course, the Ten Commandments).\n\nThe year 1844 was also important for Karl Marx, the founder of communism. That year, Marx wrote a work called the “Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844,” published posthumously by the Soviet Union in 1932. The manuscripts show the early development of Marx’s ideology in which he argued for a totally materialist reality that moved through various economic stages until the workers of the world united, overthrew their capitalist oppressors, and created a utopia on earth.\n\nThe year 1844 was an important one for Charles Darwin, too. In what has become known as the “Essay of 1844,” Darwin produced one of the earliest expressions of his evolutionary theory, even if it was not then made public. Only in 1859, with the publication of the book On the Origin of Species, did Darwin publicly promulgate his view that all life on earth originated from a common ancestor by natural and chance processes alone.\n\nThe year 1844 was also, however, the fulfillment of the 2,300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14 and the same year that, out of the leftovers of the Great Disappointment, seeds were planted that would burgeon in a worldwide movement whose core message repudiates the core of Nietzschean, Marxist, and Darwinian ideology.\n\nContrary to Nietzsche, the Seventh-day Adventist movement proclaimed that not only does God exist, but His universal code of morality (the “Old Law tablets”), the Ten Commandments, remains His ultimate standard of judgment and binding over all humanity.\n\nContrary to Marx, the Seventh-day Adventist movement proclaimed that the great controversy between Christ and Satan, not a materialist flow of history, explained both our world’s history up to that point and how our history will end in the future: not in a human-made communist utopia, but in the supernatural establishment of God’s eternal kingdom.\n\nAnd contrary to Darwin, the Seventh-day Adventist movement taught that life originated not in the natural and chance process of random mutation and natural selection, but by the power of the Creator God, who in six days created life on earth and rested on the seventh.\n\nCould it be a coincidence that all these events happened in 1844? One should not think so.\n\nNietzsche, Marx, Darwin—three influential figures whose work has caused humanity irreparable harm. But amid all these errors, God did not leave the world without a witness to His truth, which is why, among these destructive ideologies, He raised up a movement that would, over time, morph into the Seventh-day Adventist Church and that would proclaim His last-day truth to the world: the three angels’ messages. These messages refute the errors and misconceptions promoted by those three terribly deceived men.\n\nIn a sense, the three angels’ messages are the marching orders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. At their core, they are the gospel, pure and simple, but the gospel declared in the context of “present truth” (2 Pet. 1:12). And this, the three angels’ messages, is our study for the quarter.",

        "introduction": "### A word about what’s ahead...\n\nThe goal of Cornerstone Connections is to lead you to the Bible to see the big story of God and people. This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nCordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### Managing for the Master—Till He Comes\n\nIt is difficult for us to fully comprehend the relationship that our God, the Creator of the universe, wants to have with us as human beings. (The mere idea of it is astounding!) “Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!” (1 John 3:1, NKJV). Or as Ellen G. White wrote: “Can any human dignity equal this? What higher position can we occupy than to be called the sons of the infinite God? . . . Can any worldly honor equal this?”—God’s Amazing Grace, p. 341. It’s only the darkness of this sin-laden world that causes us not to appreciate fully the status that we have been given in Jesus.\n\nYet, if we are not careful, the lure of the world and the things of the world will pull us away from Christ. The Word of God informs us of the temptations and allurements of Satan. “But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows” (1 Tim. 6:9, 10, NKJV).\n\nThe Lord, however, gives us guidance on how to earn money and utilize it wisely and not to let it be something that, as Paul warned, can lead to “destruction and perdition.” In the more than two thousand verses in the Scriptures that deal with money and possessions and our attitude toward them, God gives practical instruction on how to live above the stresses of life and to manage in financially faithful ways what we have been given.\n\nIn this quarter’s lessons, we will study God’s ideal in our relationship with Him and clearly see how we can develop a trust so deep that we will remain faithful to Him, even when we can’t buy or sell. (See Rev. 13:17.) But this kind of faith does not come overnight; by faithfully managing what God has given us, we can be prepared, even now, for whatever comes our way.\n\nGod is the One with the resources, and when we work with Him, He allows us to handle them for Him. It is the Savior’s purpose that human beings, purified and sanctified, shall be His helping hand. For this great privilege, let us give thanks to Him “who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins” (Col. 1:13, 14).\n\nGod’s counsel to His children through the wise man, Solomon, is: “Honor the Lord with your possessions, and with the firstfruits of all your increase” (Prov. 3:9, NKJV). This counsel is appropriate because “ ‘You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created’ ” (Rev. 4:11, NKJV).\n\nFrom a merely secular perspective, we live in very challenging and stressful times. However, our Christian worldview gives us confidence and hope as we see the signs Jesus gave to let us know that the great climax of human history, the second coming of Christ, is very near—even at the door. We pray that these practical lessons will deepen your faith and trust in God and encourage you to be a faithful manager for Him.\n\n_G.

If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child.

        "introduction": "### Managing for the Master Until He Comes\n\nGod wants to save sinners. He also wants to be their Friend. Sometimes we have a hard time understanding these two wonderful Bible truths. The Bible tells us, “The Father has loved us so much! God shows how much he loved us: We are called [named] children of God. And we really are his children. But the people in the world [who are not part of God’s church] don’t understand that we are God’s children, because they have not known him” (1 John 3:1, ERV). Or, as Ellen G. White wrote: “God names us His sons and daughters. . . . Can any honor we get in this life match this honor from God?”—God’s Amazing Grace, page 341, adapted. Sin is the reason we can’t understand this honor as much as we should.\n\nSo, we must be careful. We must behave in ways that help us remember Jesus. The Bible warns us about Satan’s tricks and the things he uses to get us to sin. “People who want to be rich have trouble. They get caught in a trap. They want many foolish things which are wrong for them. Because of this [trap], men are lost and punished for ever” (1 Timothy 6:9, WE).\n\nThe Lord gives us a way to avoid Satan’s money trap. God gives us advice about how to be good managers. God shows us in the Bible how to earn money and spend money wisely. More than 2,000 verses in the Bible talk about money and stuff. God tells us how to manage our money during hard times. God also tells us how we can honor Him in this life with everything He gives us.\n\nIn this quarter’s guide, we will study God’s plan for how we may serve Him with faith. We will learn how we can trust God so much that we will be loyal to Him even when we can no longer buy or sell. (Read Revelation 13:17.) Faith this strong doesn’t happen overnight. We must grow this faith by being wise managers of everything God gives us. Then we will be ready for any disaster or trouble that happens in this life.\n\nGod is the One who gives us everything. He owns everything in heaven and on earth. When we work with God, He allows us to manage His riches for Him. At the same time, God wants to give us more than money and riches in this life. God wants to free us from sin. God wants our hearts to be filled with His love. He also wants us to work with Him every day. So, we should give thanks to God for this wonderful honor. We should thank God because “God made us free from the power [kingdom] of darkness [Satan and sin]. And he brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son. The Son paid the price to make us free. In him we have forgiveness of [for] our sins” (Colossians 1:13, 14, ERV).\n\nGod’s advice to His children is: “Honor the Lord with your wealth [money]. Give him the first share [the best part] of all your crops” (Proverbs 3:9, NIrV). This advice is good wisdom to follow because we should honor God more than anyone and anything in this life. The Bible tells us that the angels in heaven honor and praise God above everyone and everything, too. “They say: ‘Our Lord and God, it is right for you to have praise and [honor] and power [control]. You made all things. They were made and have life because you wanted them’ ” (Revelation 4:11, WE).\n\nToday, we live during very hard times. As Christians, we have hope. We see the signs that Jesus gave us to let us know that His coming is very near. We pray that these lessons will make your faith stronger. We hope you will learn to trust in God more this quarter. May these lessons also encourage you to be a wise manager for Jesus.\n\n_G. Edward Reid studied at Andrews University, Loma Linda University, and Georgia State University. He is a pastor and lawyer. For many years he worked as a leader for the North American Division. He is an expert in how to manage money for the Lord._",

        "introduction": "### Introduction\n\nBiblical narratives are powerful ways to express God’s instructions and admonitions. Referring to the Old Testament stories, Paul says that “everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope” (Rom. 15:4, NIV).\n\nAccounts like those covered by this Bible study guide should be considered especially important for those who live in the time of the end. Continuing to reference Bible stories, Paul tells us that “all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come” (1 Cor. 10:11).\n\nIt is not by chance that many biblical narratives are related to giving. During the next 12 weeks we will focus on selected narratives for their altruism, generosity, and liberality. These are all virtues related to giving and are inherent attributes of God’s character. Those same virtues are supposed to be found in His worshippers, in those who profess to walk with Him. Their absence is an indication of a mistaken spiritual experience. As we will see in this lesson, giving becomes a gauge for the spiritual life.\n\nThrough spiritual giving—the act of giving to God as an act of worship—the character is developed. Men and women have the privilege to become like their Creator. It is interesting to note that it was only after the Fall that returning tangible things to God as an act of worship became mandatory for His children.\n\nThis indicates that this kind of giving was instituted by God as part of the plan of redemption, and as a reminder of His ability to give and to provide. It becomes not only a test of allegiance but also a crucial educational tool in the process of restoring God’s image in humankind. Ellen G. White says that “God planned the system of beneficence, in order that man might become like his Creator, benevolent and unselfish in character, and finally be a partaker with Christ of the eternal, glorious reward.” (Counsels on Stewardship [Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1940], 15.)\n\nIt is a law of the mind that the recipients of our tangible goods have the power to draw our affections (Matt. 6:21). For this reason, as we will see in the sad accounts of Ananias and Sapphira and of the rich young ruler, Satan tries to allure even God’s children to invest their goods in this world, becoming lovers of the world and of the things of the world (1 John 3:15–17), while professing to love God.\n\nOn the other side, God uses spiritual giving—an act of worship, something distinct from donations—to attract His children’s hearts to heaven and to Himself. This kind of worship should then be performed according to the specifications of Him who is worshipped, not according to the inclinations of the worshipper. The stories of Cain, Ahaz, Jeroboam, Ananias and Sapphira, and the rich young ruler will attest the nefarious results of ignoring His stipulations about giving.\n\nSatan is always inducing people not to give. When giving is avoided, and the pursuit of acquiring things becomes the leading principle in life, God’s character cannot be formed in the human heart, happiness cannot be found, and misery and death are the result. “The principle of the worldlings is to get, get,” says Ellen G. White, “and thus they expect to secure happiness; but, carried out in all its bearings, the fruit is misery and death.” (Counsels on Stewardship, 14).\n\nWhen Satan cannot stop God’s children from giving, he then stimulates them to believe that they are owners of their goods, and that they give as a favor to the church or God—frequently as a way to earn merit. Nevertheless, when Christ’s sacrifice is not discerned and/or accepted, the simple act of giving does not have the power to change the heart and convert the soul. On the contrary, it may even lead to perdition, as in the case of Ahaz. His liberal giving patterns led him to offer extremely costly sacrifices, even the life of his own son, but as an act of devotion to demons.\n\nGiving as an exercise of trust and as an act of worship, regular and systematic giving, the “God first” principle, and the temple and storehouse system are among the themes with crucial implications for God’s children, who live in the time of the end. Those subjects will be found in many of the selected narratives for this Bible study guide.

        "introduction": "### A word about what’s ahead...\n\nThe goal of Cornerstone Connections is to lead you to the Bible to see the big story of God and people. This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nCordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### On Death and Dying: Our Future Hope\n    \nGod created human beings to enjoy eternity in a loving relationship with Him and His creation. But this relationship was distorted by the mysterious appearance of sin within the heavenly courts (Isa. 14:12–15, Ezek. 28:12–19, Rev. 12:7–12) and the subsequent fall of Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:1–19, Rom. 5:12). Tragically, death engulfed not only the human race but also all life, as well. Expressions of death can be seen today in the leaves that fall from the trees, the flowers that fade in our vases, our innocent pets who die in agony, and our beloved ones who are taken from us so brutally. Our world is full of suffering and unwiped tears.\n\nLonging for a better world, people have painted for themselves many “paradises” in which they would like to live. For example, in 1933 English novelist James Hilton released his book, Lost Horizon, which a few years later was turned into a film under the same title. The film captures the plight of people on an airplane that runs out of fuel, eventually crashing into the snow-covered Himalayan Mountains. The pilot dies in the crash, but the few who survive are pulled from the wreckage and escorted by a group of Tibetans to the paradisiac valley of Shangri-La. Isolated from the outside world, the inhabitants grow in love and wisdom, living an almost immortal life of enduring harmony and joy. \n\nOf course, it’s only fiction.\n\nAs mortal human beings, we need assurance in the present and hope for the future. As well stated by the Swiss theologian Emil Brunner: “What oxygen is for the lungs, such is hope for the meaning of human life. Take oxygen away and death occurs through suffocation, take hope away and humanity is constricted through lack of breath; despair supervenes, spelling the paralysis of intellectual and spiritual powers by a feeling of the senselessness and purposelessness of existence. As the fate of the human organism is dependent on the supply of oxygen, so the fate of humanity is dependent on its supply of hope.”—Eternal Hope (London: Lutterworth Press, 1954), p. 7. Indeed, the biblical hope sustains us during the existential crises we face in our journey toward eternity.\n\nIn contrast to the fictional Shangri-La of the Lost Horizon, our hope of eternal life does “not follow cunningly devised fables” (2 Pet. 1:16, NKJV). It is based on God’s trustworthy promise of a perfect world with no more tears, pain, or death (Rev. 21:1–5). This precious promise inspired the apostolic church and was held, and cherished, by many Christians throughout the centuries. Without ever losing its power, this same promise gives meaning and purpose to our present lives. It allows us to look with confidence into the future. It assures us that all our beloved ones who died in Christ will finally be raised from the dead to inherit eternal life. \n\nThe present Bible study guide deals with the subject of the great controversy between good and evil from the perspective of two major themes. One is the origin and ongoing existence of sin and death. The other theme is God’s enduring work to solve these problems and bring the world back to its original perfect condition. Special emphasis also is given to the mortal nature of human beings and how the resurrection is what leads to immortality. In reality, we should not fear death because Christ died for us and overcame the power of death. Actually, we are assured that He holds “ ‘the keys to death and to the place of the dead’ ” (Rev. 1:18, NCV).\n\nThis quarter, we will explore the painful subject of death but through the lens of the hope offered us through Jesus.\n\n_Alberto R.

They want you to know more about God and His love for you and your family. And that’s what God wants too. He wants you to know that He loves you very much. And Jesus wants to be your special, forever friend. He wants you to know Him, to know all about Him. He wants you to be His friend too.\n\nAs you learn more about God’s love in these lessons, think about ways you can show your love to Him. Can you sing a song of praise to Him? Can you tell Him in your prayers how wonderful He is? Can you show His love to others in your family? To your friends and neighbors?\n\nWe pray that God will always have a special place in your heart. The Editors",

If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm and have fun with the Do & Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it. Let your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child.

        "introduction": "### Our Future Hope\n\nGod made humans to live forever in loving friendship with Him and everything He made. But this friendship was broken by sin. Sin is a mystery. No one really understands how it happened. Sin first started with Lucifer in the courts in heaven (Isaiah 14:12–15; Ezekiel 28:12–19; Revelation 12:7–12) and then later with Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:1–19; Romans 5:12). Sad to say, humans started to die, and so did all life on earth. Death is everywhere we look today: in the leaves that fall and the flowers that dry up in our vases. We see death when our innocent pets die in pain and when death takes away our family and friends. Life is full of suffering and tears.\n\nAs humans, we know that we will die. So, we need hope for this life now and hope for the future. The Swiss Bible thinker, Emil Brunner, says the same thing: “Human life needs hope the same as the lungs need air. Remove air from the lungs and what happens? A person will die. Remove hope from humans, and they will not want to live. Humans depend on air to live. In the same way, humans also depend on hope to live, too.”—Emil Brunner, Eternal Hope (London: Lutterworth Press, 1954), page 7, adapted. The Bible hope helps keep us alive and well during the troubles we meet on our journey to heaven.\n\nOur hope of everlasting life is not a clever story “that people invented” (2 Peter 1:16, ERV). Our hope comes from God’s promise that He will give us a perfect earth with no more tears, pain, or death (Revelation 21:1–5). We can trust this promise. This precious promise helped the church in New Testament times to have hope. This promise gave hope to many Christians since that time. This same promise gives us hope and comforts us, too. This promise gives us hope that we will see our loved ones again because they accepted Jesus. Jesus will wake them up from the dead at His Second Coming. Then they will get everlasting life.\n\nThis quarter’s Bible study guide talks about the topic of the worldwide war between God and Satan. We will look at two parts of this war. These two parts can be asked as questions. (1) How did sin and death start? And (2) what did God do in the past to solve these problems? Also, what is God doing today to make the earth new again? We will study about what happens when we die. We also will look at the resurrection. The resurrection is the time when God will wake up His sleeping saints at the Second Coming. We will learn about how the resurrection will lead to everlasting life. Then we will not be afraid of death. Jesus died for us. Jesus won the war over sin and death. Jesus announces, “ ‘I am the One who lives. I was dead, but look: I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and where the dead are’ ” (Revelation 1:18, ICB).\n\nThis quarter, we will learn about the painful topic of death. But we will always remember the promise of hope that Jesus gives us.\n\n_Dr. Alberto R. Timm works for the Ellen G. White Estate at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists._",

        "introduction": "#### Beyond Death\n\nWe live in a world that is obsessed with the supernatural. Spiritualism has inundated the media and the entertainment world. One regularly hears about zombies, out-of-body and near-death experiences, ghosts, zombies, and spirits of the dead coming back as angels. Sadly, spiritualism, once taboo among Christians, has even infiltrated the Christian church. The foundational idea of spiritualism is that people can live in sin in this life and still live forever.\n\nThose of us who believe that the dead sleep until the resurrection use some favorite verses to prove our point. The most common is Ecclesiastes 9:5. “For the living know that they will die; but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten” (ESV). This verse is unambiguously clear, right? Yes, it is. There are other verses in Scripture, however, that seem to teach that the soul survives the body at death. Passages such as the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19–31), absent from the body and present with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:1–10), the spirits of just men made perfect (Hebrews 12:22–24), the thief on the cross (Luke 23:42), the souls under the altar (Revelation 6:9–11), Rachel’s departing soul (Genesis 35:18), and the dead who stand before God (Revelation 20:12) can be perplexing even to those who believe in “soul sleep.”\n\nAs Seventh-day Adventists, we cannot simply brush these difficult texts aside and act as if they don’t exist. Neither can we ignore them or make lists of texts that compete with the texts of those who believe in the immortality of the soul. We must honestly and carefully study them to show that they are in perfect harmony with Ecclesiastes 9:5.\n\nIn this quarter’s lessons, we will examine some of these difficult texts. An ability to explain them is vitally important because the Bible tells us that Satan will use all his deceptive power at the end of days to sweep the world into the delusion of spiritualism in its various forms. The book of Revelation describes the spirits of devils going out to gather the whole world for the final battle against God (Revelation 16:13, 14).\n\nSatan’s target audience will be the elect (Matthew 24:24), and therefore they must be firmly rooted in the truth that the dead are dead and cannot communicate with the living. Someday soon, God’s people will be brought before judges and rulers to give reasons for their faith (Luke 21:12–15), and the perplexing texts on the state of the dead will undoubtedly come up. Will God’s people be able to explain them in a way that will convict these civic leaders? Ellen White wrote: “Many will have to stand in the legislative courts; some will have to stand before kings and before the learned of the earth, to answer for their faith. Those who have only a superficial understanding of truth will not be able clearly to expound the Scriptures, and give definite reasons for their faith” (_Fundamentals of Christian Education_, 217).\n\nIn Eden, Satan disguised his identity by using a serpent as a medium and deceived Eve with two inseparable lies. First, he told Eve that she did not have to obey God’s command because her own wisdom would enable her to distinguish between good and evil. Second, he told her that if she ate the fruit, she would not die but live forever. In short, disobey the law and live forever! Two voices spoke in Eden—the voice of God and the voice of the serpent. Obedience to God’s Word meant loyalty to His authority, while obedience to the serpent’s word mean loyalty to the serpent’s authority.\n\nThe same issue will face the world in the final days. Satan’s power to deceive at the end will be far greater than it was at the beginning. “Satan, working now with tenfold greater power, succeeds as of old in blinding the eyes of men and darkening their understanding” (Ellen G. White, _Signs of the Times_, June 21, 1883). “Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions” (White, _The Great Controversy_, 588). Matthew 24:23–27 and 2 Thessalonians 2:1–13 tell us that Satan will even counterfeit the second coming of Christ by impersonating Him. If Satan can impersonate Christ, he and his angels can certainly disguise themselves as human beings, especially departed relatives and friends.\n\nThe focus of this quarter is not on Satan but on the Savior’s admonition to His disciples about the nature of death, what is beyond death, and the deceptions associated with the afterlife. It will be the student’s task to apply biblical principles in the contemporary context to discern what is truth from error. This study will look at the more difficult Bible passages to secure in the Christian disciple to trust the Word deeper, rely on the Holy Spirit harder, and continue her/his devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ higher.",

        "introduction": "### A word about what’s ahead...\n\nThe goal of Cornerstone Connections is to lead you to the Bible to see the big story of God and people. This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day.

        "introduction": "### The Crucified Creator\n\n“All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made” (John 1:3).\n\nAll things” were made by Him, Jesus, and yet—according to Scripture—“Jesus wept” (John 11:35). The Creator wept? Even more so, Jesus was “despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief ” (Isa. 53:3). The Creator, a man of sorrows, despised and rejected? And He once cried out, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Matt. 27:46).\n\nHow could these things be? It’s because Jesus, our Creator, also was our Redeemer, and as such, He was the Crucified God—the Creator who took on humanity and in that humanity suffered through a life of privation and toil that ended with Him hung on a Roman cross.\n\nThus, our Creator, the One in whom “we live, and move, and have our being” (Acts 17:28), suffered in humanity in ways that none of us ever could. We can experience only our own griefs, our own sorrows; at the cross He bore “our griefs, and carried our sorrows” (Isa. 53:4)—all of them. It’s the most amazing act in all cosmic history.\n\nWith that background (that of the crucified God lifted up before us), we will for the next few months seek to better comprehend the incomprehensible—our own suffering, the sufferings of Christians, of those who have committed their lives to Christ. We make no claims to have all the answers or even many; we’re claiming only that “God is love” (1 John 4:8) and that although these things happen, we can trust God despite them and, indeed, grow in grace through them, no matter how painful the process.\n\nThis quarter we will study the Word of God and see how other flesh and blood, though radiated in faith, nevertheless faced despair, betrayal, disappointment, loss, injustice, and abuse (sound like anything you can relate to?). How did they cope? What did they learn? What can their examples teach us?\n\nAs we look at these people, their experiences, their struggles, and their trials of faith (which might be much like our own), we must always see them contrasted against the background of the Cross. We must always remember that no matter what anyone faces, Jesus Christ, our Creator and Redeemer, went through worse.\n\nOur God is a suffering God. Even Albert Camus, hardly a Christian, understood some of the implications of the Cross and the sufferings of God there: “The night on Golgotha is so important in the history of man only because, in its shadow, the divinity abandoned its traditional privileges and drank to the last drop, despair included, the agony of death.”—The Rebel (New York: Vintage International, 1991), p. 33. Or, as Ellen G. White expressed it: “The cross is a reve­lation to our dull senses of the pain that, from its very inception, sin has brought to the heart of God.”—Education, p. 263.\n\nOur lessons are not a theodicy, the justification of God in the face of evil. Instead, as we’ve said, they’re an attempt to help us work through the inevitable suffering we all face here in a world in which sinning is as easy as breathing. What we will try to show is that pain, suffering, and loss don’t mean that God has abandoned us; they mean only that, even as believers, we now share in the common lot of a fallen race. The difference is that through Jesus and the hope He offers, we can find meaning and purpose in what seems meaningless and purposeless and that somehow, even if we can’t imagine how, we can trust the promise that “all things work together for good to those who love God” (Rom. 8:28, NKJV)—the God who, though He made all things, suffered all things, too (and that’s why we love Him).\n\nGavin Anthony, this quarter’s principal contributor, grew up in Sri Lanka as a missionary kid. He worked as a pastor in England and was conference president in Iceland when he authored these lessons.\n\n",

If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm and have fun with the Do & Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it. Let your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.\n\nContact us through our Web site at www.gracelink.net.\n\nWith Affection,\n\n_General Conference Sabbath School Department_",

        "introduction": "### The Suffering Savior\n\nThe Bible tells us that Jesus made everything: “God made everything by the Word [Jesus]. Nothing has been made without him” (John 1:3, WE). At the same time, the Bible also tells us that the One who made everything also is the One who “cried” (John 11:35) when His friend Lazarus died. Jesus cried? Yes. What is more, “people looked down on him. They didn’t accept him. He knew all about pain and suffering. He was like [the same as] someone people turn their faces away from” (Isaiah 53:3, NIrV). Jesus was hated and rejected? Yes. When Jesus died, He cried, “ ‘My God, my God, why have you left me alone?’ ” (Matthew 27:46, ERV).\n\nHow are these awful things possible? The answer is that Jesus, who made us, also is our Savior. As our Savior, He died on the cross. He became human, one of us. He suffered as we suffer. He lived life as a poor Man. He worked hard. Then His life ended on a Roman cross.\n\nSo, the One who made us (Acts 17:28) suffered in many ways, more than any of us. We can know only our own pain and suffering. But at the cross, Jesus “suffered the things we should have suffered. He took [accepted] on himself the pain that should have been ours” (Isaiah 53:4, NIrV). What Jesus did on the cross is the most surprising and wonderful act in the history of heaven and earth.\n\nFor the next few months, we will try to better understand a topic that is difficult to understand: suffering. We will look at human suffering and the sufferings of Christians. We will ask hard questions. We don’t have all the answers to these questions. But we know for sure that “God is love” (1 John 4:8, KJV). Yes, terrible things happen in this life. But we can trust God in all our pain and loss. God will help us to grow closer to Him no matter what we suffer.\n\nThis quarter, we will study the Bible to see how other humans suffered loss and pain. What were their experiences? What did they do? What did they learn? What can their examples teach us?\n\nAs we look at these people and their experiences, we must always remember the Cross. Whatever suffering and pain we meet in this life, Jesus suffered worse at Calvary.\n\nOur God is a suffering God. Albert Camus was a thinker and writer, who did not believe in God. But even Camus understood that what happened at the Cross was very important. Camus wrote: “The night on Golgatha is very important in human history. There, on the cross, God gave up the things that belonged to Him. He ‘drank’ suffering, pain, and death to the last drop.”—Albert Camus, The Rebel (New York: Vintage International, 1991), page 33, adapted. \n\nOur lessons are not going to try to explain why God punishes evil. What we want to do this quarter is help you understand better the suffering that all of us suffer on an earth filled with sin. What we will try to show is God does not leave us alone when we suffer pain and loss. Pain, suffering, and loss mean only that we share in the experience of being human. But Jesus offers us hope in our suffering. We can find meaning in pain that seems to have no meaning at all. Maybe we can’t understand how suffering helps us to have hope. But we can trust God’s promise that “we know that God works out everything for the good of those who love him” (Romans 8:28, WE). Our God who made all things also suffered all things, too. That’s why we love Him.\n\n_Gavin Anthony wrote this quarter’s guide. He grew up in Sri Lanka. Gavin’s parents worked in Sri Lanka as Bible workers for the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Without the record of God declaring the seventh day holy, nothing would differentiate the time on the first day from that on the seventh. Accepting the creation narrative as the authoritative account of origins requires faith (Heb. 11:3). In the same manner, embracing the holiness of the Sabbath is a faith venture. Faithfully observing the Sabbath facilitates an allegiance to the God who created the world in six literal days by His Word.\n\nComing to us pristine from the Garden of Eden, the Sabbath teaches lessons as it is kept, meditated upon, and shared. It is a microcosm of salvation theology, a harbinger of faith, and an indication of one’s fealty. Given as a gift to all of humanity at the beginning of time, it enshrines an understanding of God’s character as revealed through His work. Those who keep it are themselves kept from a myriad of pitfalls in their Christian walk, and they may experience joy in their journey with Jesus.\n\nTrue Sabbath-keeping has implications beyond one’s behavior on the seventh day. In order to enter into the rest of the Sabbath, proper preparation is required, because Sabbath observance is more than a legalistic cessation of labor. The Christian must enter into the spirit of the Sabbath that transcends the day. Civic engagement, social benevolence, and environmental concern are the natural outflow of being a Sabbath keeper.\n\nThe depth and breadth of the meaning of the Sabbath could not possibly be encapsulated in this abbreviated thirteen-week study. Rather, these lessons present a few reflections on the Sabbath. They are an invitation to engage the Sabbath experience more meaningfully, regardless of whether someone has always known about the Sabbath or if the concept is new to them.\n\nThis study is not primarily an apologetic presentation of the Sabbath. It does not seek to answer objections, common or uncommon, to the Sabbath. Nor does it seek to establish the validity of a seventh-day Sabbath. We assume the Sabbath is a holy stretch of time extending from sunset to sunset every seventh day of the week. There are a myriad books, articles, and oral presentations that address arguments against the Sabbath—this is not one of them. This is not a defense of the Sabbath.\n\nAt the end of these lessons, it is our prayer that you will more fully delight in the Sabbath day. May these studies challenge any false preconceived notions about what it means to truly rest in Jesus. And may your Sabbath observance take on a renewed vivacity.",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nCordially, The Editors",

        "introduction": "### The Book of the Beginning\n\nGenesis is about Jesus: Jesus our Creator, Jesus our Sustainer, Jesus our Redeemer. Writing millennia after the Genesis text itself had been penned by Moses, and reaching back across those ages to the patriarch’s very words, the apostle John reveals Jesus in the Creation account: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men” (John 1:1–4, NKJV).\n\nWhat did John write here? “In the beginning” all things that were made, all things that once didn’t exist, came into existence—by Jesus. All creation—from galaxies hurtling across the cosmos in staggering pinwheels of fire and light to the meticulous DNA woven miraculously into the cell to quantum waves—Jesus created and sustains it all. And the book of Genesis is the first story in Scripture of both this creation and the redemption of this creation. Here, in this book, is the world’s only “official” account of our origins.\n\nThe English word “Genesis” is derived from the Greek genesis, which means “beginning,” itself derived from the Hebrew bere’shit, “in the beginning”—the first word of the book (hence, the first word of the entire Bible!). Genesis gives us the foundation, the base, upon which all the following scriptures rest. Because it is first, and so foundational to all that comes after, Genesis is probably the most quoted or referred-to book in the rest of the Scriptures.\n\nGenesis is important because it is the book that, more than any other work, anywhere, helps us understand just who we are as human beings, a truth especially important now, in a day when we humans are deemed as nothing but accidents, chance creations of a purely materialistic universe. Or, as one physicist put it, we humans are “organized mud” (which is to some degree true, though for him the laws of nature alone organized it!). Genesis, however, reveals to us our true origin, that we were beings purposely and perfectly made in the image of God in a perfect world. Genesis also explains the Fall—that is, why our world is no longer perfect and why we as humans aren’t, as well. Genesis, however, also comforts us with God’s promise of salvation in a world that, in and of itself, offers us nothing but suffering and death.\n\nWith its dramatic stories of miracles (Creation, births, the rainbow) and judgments (the Flood, Sodom and Gomorrah) witnessing to God’s holy presence, Genesis is awe inspiring. But Genesis also is a book with moving human stories of love (Jacob and Rachel), of hatred (Jacob and Esau), of birth (Isaac, Jacob, Jacob’s sons), of death (Sarah, Rachel, Jacob, Joseph), of murder (Cain, Simeon, and Levi), and forgiveness (Esau and Jacob, Joseph and his brothers). It also is an instruction book with lessons on ethics (Cain, Babel), on faith (Abraham, Jacob), and on the hope and promise of redemption (the crushing of the serpent, the Promised Land).\n\nDuring this quarter, not only will we read and study the book of Genesis—but we also will enjoy its beautiful stories and learn to walk better with the Lord of Creation, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n\nMeanwhile, the geographical movements of the book—from Eden to Babel, to the Promised Land, to Egypt, to the prospect of the Promised Land—remind us of our nomadic journeys and nurture our hope for the real Promised Land, the new heaven and the new earth. As we follow these characters across the pages of Genesis, we will discover that—regardless of how different the time, place, culture, and circumstance—often their stories are, in many ways, ours, as well.\n\n_Jacques B.

Be sure to take the right lesson to Sabbath School with you each week.\n\n**Step 2**: Use each week’s lesson in the way that is best for you. Each section has a day of the week listed beside it, but you may want to mix and match sections as you study. The sections work in any order.\n\n**Step 3**: Review the memory verse each day of the week.\n\n**Step 4**: Be prepared to share your thoughts and discoveries with your Sabbath School class.",

They want you to know more about God and His love for you and your family. And that’s what God wants too. He wants you to know that He loves you very much. And Jesus wants to be your special, forever friend. He wants you to know Him, to know all about Him. He wants you to be His friend too.\n\nAs you learn more about God’s love in these lessons, think about ways you can show your love to Him. Can you sing a song of praise to Him? Can you tell Him in your prayers how wonderful He is? Can you show His love to others in your family? To your friends and neighbors?\n\nWe pray that God will always have a special place in your heart. The Editors",

If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

In these lessons the chil- dren will be introduced to three major themes—God’s grace as it is shown through His love for us; worshiping God by praising Him for His loving care; and loving one another as part of being in a community.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm and have fun with the Do & Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it. Let your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.\n\nContact us through our Web site at www.gracelink.net.\n\nWith Affection,\n\n_General Conference Sabbath School Department_",

        "introduction": "### The book of the Beginning\n\nGenesis is about Jesus. Jesus made us. Jesus keeps us alive. Jesus is also our Savior. Moses wrote the book of Genesis. Thousands of years after Moses, John shows us Jesus as the One who made us, too: “The Word (Christ [Jesus]) was in the beginning. The Word was with God. The Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. He made all things. Nothing was made without Him making it. Life began by Him. His Life was the Light for men” (John 1:1–4, NLV). \n\nSo, John tells us that Jesus made everything. Jesus made all the planets and stars. Jesus made our cells and our DNA, which are the “building blocks” of life. Jesus made all these things. Jesus holds everything He made together, too. The book of Genesis is the first story in the Bible. This story shows us that Jesus made this earth and saves us from sin. Genesis is the only book on earth that shows us why we are here.\n\nThe word “Genesis” comes from a Greek word that means “beginning.” This Greek word comes from the Hebrew word \n\n“bere’ shit,” which means “in the beginning.” These are the first words of the book of Genesis and the whole Bible! The whole Bible comes from the spiritual truths in Genesis. More Bible writers use quotes from Genesis than from any other book in the Bible.\n\nGenesis is important because it helps us understand who we are as humans. We need this knowledge more than ever today. Most people now believe that humans are mistakes or “accidents.” They believe that life on earth started by chance. But Genesis shows us that these ideas are wrong. Genesis teaches us that God made us to look the same as Himself. God also made us to be the same as Himself in many ways, too. Then God put the first humans in a beautiful garden on a perfect earth. Genesis also explains how sin happened. We learn why life on this earth is no longer perfect. We learn why humans are not perfect anymore. Genesis also gives us comfort. We see in Genesis the promise of a Savior. This promise gives us hope in a life that offers us nothing but suffering and death.\n\nThe book of Genesis tells us many stories of miracles. We read about how God made the skies and the earth. We also read about the first rainbow. Genesis teaches us about the Flood and Sodom and Gomorrah. We see God everywhere in the stories of Genesis. That is why we are filled with love for God when we read these stories. The book of Genesis also has beautiful love stories. One of the most famous love stories is about Jacob and Rachel. Or how about Isaac and Rebekah? These stories touch our hearts. Then there are stories about hate (Jacob and Esau). Or babies being born (Isaac, Jacob, and the 12 sons of Jacob). We read stories about death (Sarah, Rachel, Jacob, and Joseph). We also read about killing (Cain, Simeon, and Levi). There are stories about forgiveness (Esau and Jacob, Joseph and his brothers). Genesis also teaches us about good and evil (Cain, the Tower of Babel). We also learn about faith (Abraham, Jacob). Most of all, we feel hope in the story about the promise of God to save us. We see this hope in the promise that God will step on the head of the snake and destroy it forever. We also see this same hope in the story about the Promised Land.\n\nDuring this quarter, we will read and study the book of Genesis. We also will enjoy its beautiful stories. They will teach us to live more closely to the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n\nWe will also see that the people in the book of Genesis take many trips. They travel from Eden to Babel, from the Promised Land to Egypt. The book ends with the hope that the children of Israel have of traveling back to the Promised Land. The hope of Israel helps us remember our own hope in the real Promised Land. This land is the new heaven and the new earth. As we read the stories in Genesis, we will see that their stories are in many ways our stories, too.\n\n_Jacques B. Doukhan, DHL, ThD, is a retired professor.

        "introduction": "### Introduction\n\nThe Letter of James is treasured by some for its simplicity and instruction. Others, alongside the likes of Martin Luther, struggle to see past its apparent contradictions with other passages of Scripture and stay away from it. While James does write some rather inflammatory observations about faith (and the rich, and words), when observed in their context, they harmonize seamlessly with the rest of inspiration. Observing the words of James closely is a focal point of this quarter.\n\nThat said, this quarter does not focus on defending the validity of James. Instead, it is a verse-by-verse study of his bite-sized counsel and how it continues to apply to modern-day believers. The parallels with the Gospels and other books of the Bible (both Old Testament and New) confirm its validity and reveal its unique way of exploring “old” truths.\n\nFollowing the poetic theology of Hebrews, James can be a startlingly practical book. His abstract parables serve only to better inform the reader of the practical conclusions he is explaining. Writing to believers “scattered abroad,” his counsel ranges from interacting with people at dinner parties to planning future business ventures to the personal struggle with sin. His counsel bears evidence of a close acquaintance with real life, both the joyful and the devastating. In all these things, he maintains one central point: true faith is expressed in the believer’s life.\n\nFaith is not a mental assent; it is something testable, even something to be withheld out of prejudice (James 1:3; 2:2–4). Faith is access to a tangible reality not yet realized, and yet it is the essential ingredient in living a life that matters now (James 2:5, 26; 5:7, 8). When real, it cannot help but be expressed in the life; any faith that is not seen gives evidence of its inauthenticity (James 2:20, 26).\n\nJames cuts to the root of sins that are often glossed over: selfishness, unsanctified speech, and a fixation on wealth. He wastes no time in pointing out how destructive these sins are, even though—or especially because—they are acceptable by worldly standards. Faith implicitly works for the good of others (James 2:14–16). If a mouth praises God and curses other people, it is unacceptable and gives evidence of a contrary heart (James 3:9–12). The wealthy may barricade themselves with their gold and silver, but they cannot escape the consequences of what they do with what they have (James 5:1–6). James explores these three areas in focused sections, but also brings them up throughout the rest of the book.\n\nThough some of his instruction can be construed as harsh, James’s pastoral heart is threaded throughout as he appeals to his “brethren” to listen to his counsel. With an inspired and eternal perspective, he lays plain the consequences of an unyielded, unsurrendered life. Like a watchman observing the horizon, he pleads with the believers to live the life that Jesus died for them to have while it is still available to them. If still in wickedness, turn away, he says; if surrendered, be patient until “the coming of the Lord” (James 5:8).\n\nThough detailed, this study is nowhere exhaustive for the same reason that no human-made study can be exhaustive of even the shortest passage of Scripture. As you study this quarter, remember the overarching themes and the God who inspired them all. Observe your life and ask if your faith can be seen by others. When conviction comes from one point or another, remember that all works are to be done by faith in Jesus Christ. Works are done as a result of salvation by faith, not to merit it. When you depend on Him, your life can glorify God, just as Jesus said it would all those years ago (Matt. 5:16). ",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

        "introduction": "### In These Last Days: The Message of Hebrews\n\nIt was at church when he first saw her. He was running an errand, absorbed in his thoughts, when the sight hit him. The painting was a little less than two meters high and three meters wide, but the girl portrayed in it exerted a strange captivating force over the young man. Why could he not take his eyes off of her? What was it? After some reflection, he realized that it was her eyes. The painting portrayed only her face, and she was looking at something intently. But what, and why was she so absorbed in it? For a long time afterward, he couldn’t get the painting out of his head.\n\nSeveral years later, the painter, Arnold Jiménez, revealed some of its secrets to him. The painting was made to attract viewers to her eyes, but the real secret was in her pupils. If you looked closely, you would find out that they reflected what she was looking at. Her eyes were fixed on Jesus on the cross.\n\nThe portrait of Jesus in the Letter to the Hebrews can exert a similar captivating force upon us. Jesus is described, first of all, as the ruler of the universe enthroned at God’s right hand. Innumerable angels celebrate Him, worship Him, and serve Him (Heb. 1:5–14, Heb. 12:22–24). He has won the right to rule because He has ensured the destruction of the devil (Heb. 2:14–16) through His own death. Jesus also is the exalted High Priest. Sinless and perfectly holy, He lives forever to minister in our behalf in the heavenly sanctuary (Heb. 7:26–8:5). He has won the right to do so because He offered Himself as a perfect, once-for-all sacrifice, effective for everyone and forever (Heb. 10:1–14). Jesus also has mediated a new covenant between God and His people that will stand forever (Heb. 8:6–13).\n\nWhat captivates readers about the portrait of Jesus, however, is not simply what Jesus has done but who He is. He was born from a woman, as we were, and He has been tempted and ridiculed, as we have been. Yet, still, He sits at the center of power in the universe. When we gaze at the heavenly scene, with its diverse and fantastic celestial beings, our eyes are attracted to the One in the center of it all, who, amazingly enough, looks like us because He has become one of us. Jesus, our Brother, is there, in heaven, representing us, despite the shame of our sin and fallenness.\n\nIn the person of Jesus, three dimensions of the story of Redemption intersect. The first is the local, personal dimension. For readers tired of the reproaches and hardships of Christian life (Heb. 10:32–34), Jesus is the author and perfecter of faith. They need to look to Him, who also suffered at the hands of sinners (Heb. 10:32–34, Heb. 12:1–4). The second is the corporate, national dimension. For the people of God, who are traveling toward God’s Promised Land, Jesus is the new Joshua. They need to follow His lead (Hebrews 3, Hebrews 4, Hebrews 11, Hebrews 12). The third is the universal dimension. Jesus is the new Adam, the Son of man, in whom God’s purposes for humanity are fulfilled (Heb. 2:5–10, Heb. 12:22–28).\n\nThe portrait of Jesus, who captures the breadth and length and height and depth of God’s love for us, is our subject this quarter. And just as the image of Jesus in the eyes of the girl in the painting captured the young man’s gaze, may the image of Jesus as portrayed in Hebrews capture not just our gaze but our love and admiration for, yes, Jesus, our Brother in heaven.\n\nFélix H.

        "introduction": "### God’s Grace Sees Our Potential\n\n**Dear student,**\n\nYou are a gift from God, and He loves you very much! If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

In these lessons the chil- dren will be introduced to three major themes—God’s grace as it is shown through His love for us; worshiping God by praising Him for His loving care; and loving one another as part of being in a community.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm and have fun with the Do & Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it. Let your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.\n\nContact us through our Web site at www.gracelink.net.\n\nWith Affection,\n\n_General Conference Sabbath School Department_",

        "introduction": "#### Hebrews: A Message for the End-times\n\nA young man sees a painting of a girl in his church for the first time. The painting touches his heart deeply. He cannot stop staring at the girl. Why? he wonders. What is so special about the girl in the painting? For a long time, the young man tries to figure out why. At last, the young man understands the reason he cannot stop staring at her: her eyes. The painting shows only the face of the girl. She looks very carefully at something that is not in the painting. But what is she staring at? Why does she look so carefully at it? For a long time after the young man sees the painting, he cannot stop thinking about the eyes of the girl.\n\nSeveral years later, the young man meets the artist of the painting. The artist is named Arnold Jiménez. Arnold tells the young man the secret of the painting. Arnold painted the eyes of the girl in a special way. Arnold painted her eyes to make people look straight into them. How did the artist do this? If you look closely, you will see that the artist carefully painted in her eyes the object of her attention: Jesus on the cross. \n\nIn the letter to the Hebrews, Paul “paints” for us a picture of Jesus. The picture is so powerful. We cannot stop staring. Paul tells us that Jesus is the King of heaven and earth. Jesus sits on the right side of God in heaven. Angels worship Him: thousands and thousands of angels. There are so many angels no one can count them. All of these angels serve Jesus (Hebrews 1:5–14; Hebrews 12:22–24). Jesus controls everything in heaven and on earth because He died on the cross. His death is a promise about the future: God will destroy the devil forever (Hebrews 2:14–16). Jesus is also our High Priest, or Chief Religious Leader. Jesus never sinned. So, He is perfect and holy. Now He lives forever. He works for us in the temple in heaven (Hebrews 7:26–8:5). Jesus can help us because He gave Himself as a perfect offering for our sins. He needed to make this offering only one time. Jesus died for everyone (Hebrews 10:1–14). Jesus also made a new way for us to go to God. This new way to God is named the New Agreement. The New Agreement between God and His people will continue forever (Hebrews 8:6–13).\n\nWhat touches our hearts the most about the picture of Jesus in Hebrews? More than what Jesus did, we are touched by who Jesus is. Jesus was born from a woman. We were, too. The devil tried to get Jesus to sin. As sinners, we know how that feels. People made fun of Jesus and laughed at Him. We have been laughed at and made fun of, too. Now Jesus sits on the throne in heaven. When we make a picture in our minds of Jesus on the throne, our eyes cannot stop staring at Him. He looks so much the way we do because He became one of us. Jesus is our Brother. Now Jesus, our Brother, is in heaven. He stands between God and sinners. Jesus loves us so much. Because of His love, Jesus goes to God to get help for us. \n\nIn Jesus, we see the story about the love of God for sinners and His plan to save us. This story has three parts: (1) Jesus is our Savior. (2) Jesus is our King. (3) Jesus is the new Adam. Are you worn and tired? Have you suffered insults and hard times because of your faith (Hebrews 10:32–34)? Let Jesus lead you. Jesus is the Leader of your faith. Jesus will save you and make you perfect. He will not stop helping you. Look to Him. He suffered as you have from evil men (Hebrews 12:1–4). He understands suffering better than anyone. Jesus also knows how to bring us safely home. He traveled the way to heaven before us. Jesus is the new Joshua. Follow Him to the Promised Land (Hebrews 3, 4, 11, 12). Jesus also is the new Adam. As the new Adam, Jesus did everything God needed Him to do. Because of Jesus, God can show us mercy (Hebrews 2:5–10; Hebrews 12:22–28).\n\nThe picture of Jesus in Hebrews is our topic this quarter. Jesus shows us the love of God. Jesus shows us that this love is very deep. When we see this love, we cannot stop staring at Jesus, our Brother in heaven. \n\n_Félix H.

The painting was a little less than two meters (6.5 ft) high and three meters (10 ft) wide, but the girl portrayed in it exerted a strange, captivating force over the young man. Why could he not take his eyes off her? What was it? After some reflection, he realized it was her eyes that held his gaze. The painting portrayed only her face, and she was looking intently at something. But what was she so absorbed in, and why? For a long time afterward, he couldn’t get the painting out of his head.\n\nSeveral years later, the painter, Arnold Jiménez, revealed some of its secrets to him. The painting was made to attract viewers to her eyes, but the real secret was in her pupils. If you looked closely, you would find that they reflected what she was looking at. Her eyes were fixed on Jesus on the cross.\n\nThe portrait of Jesus in the Letter to the Hebrews can exert a similar captivating force upon us. Jesus is described, first, as the Ruler of the universe, enthroned at God’s right hand. Innumerable angels celebrate Him, worship Him, and serve Him (Heb. 1:5–14, 12:22–24). He has won the right to rule because through His own death, He has ensured the destruction of the devil (Heb. 2:14–16). Jesus is also the exalted High Priest. Sinless and perfectly holy, He lives forever to minister in our behalf in the heavenly sanctuary (Heb. 7:26–8:5). He has won the right to do so because He offered Himself as a perfect, once-for-all sacrifice, effective for everyone and forever (Heb. 10:1–14). Jesus has also mediated a new covenant between God and His people that will stand forever (Heb. 8:6–13).\n\nWhat captivates readers about the portrait of Jesus, however, is not simply what Jesus has done but who He is. He was born from a woman, as we were, and He has been tempted and ridiculed, as we have been. Yet, still, He sits at the center of power in the universe. When we gaze at the heavenly scene, with its diverse and fantastic celestial beings, our eyes are attracted to the One in the center of it all, who, amazingly enough, looks like us because He became one of us. Jesus our Brother is in heaven, representing us, despite the shame of our sin and fallenness.\n\nIn the person of Jesus, three dimensions of the story of redemption intersect. The first is the local, personal dimension. For readers tired of the reproaches and hardships of Christian life (Heb. 10:32–34), Jesus is the Author and Perfecter of faith. They need to look to Him who also suffered at the hands of sinners (Heb. 12:1–4). The second is the corporate, national dimension. For the people of God, who are traveling toward God’s promised land, Jesus is the new Joshua. They need to follow His lead (Hebrews 3, 4, 11, 12). The third is the universal dimension. Jesus is the new Adam, the Son of Man, in whom God’s purposes for humanity are fulfilled (Heb. 2:5–10, 12:22–28).\n\nThe portrait of Jesus, the One who captures the breadth and length and height and depth of God’s love for us, is our subject this quarter. And just as the image of Jesus in the eyes of the painting captured the young man’s gaze, may the image of Jesus as portrayed in Hebrews capture not just our gaze but our love and admiration for, yes, Jesus, our Brother in heaven.\n\nNote from the Editors: The manuscript of this quarter’s inVerse Bible study is based on the same manuscript as the Adult Bible Study Guide. Questions and format have been edited and adapted for the inVerse lesson structure and experience.",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day.

        "introduction": "### The Book of the Covenant: Deuteronomy\n\nThe story goes like this: during the reign of King Josiah in Jerusalem (640–609 b.c.), someone, probably working in the temple, found a copy of a book, and the book was read before King Josiah. “Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes” (2 Kings 22:11, NKJV). Why? Because he realized that he and his people were not obeying what was written in the book.\n\nThen, on the basis of that book, called the “Book of the Covenant” (2 Kings 23:2, NKJV), Josiah began a great reformation. We can read about that reformation in 2 Kings 23.\n\nWhat was the book that had such an impact on the king and his nation? It is believed to be Deuteronomy, our study for this quarter.\n\nThe fifth and last of the five books of Moses, Deuteronomy—a name that comes from the Latin word deuteronomium (which means “second law”)—could be summarized as follows:\n\nHaving left Egypt and having entered into the covenant at Sinai with the Lord, the children of Israel—instead of going directly to Canaan—wandered in the wilderness for 40 years. When the 40 years were finished and the Hebrews were finally about to cross over to the Promised Land, Moses spoke to them in a series of speeches. The essence of those speeches was: You’re now about to enter the Promised Land. Finally! Don’t forget what the Lord has done for you, and don’t forget what He asks of you now, which is to love Him with all your heart and soul and to reveal that love by obedience to all His commandments, all according to the covenant.\n\nTo stress the importance of the covenant, Moses repeated to the people the Ten Commandments, the legal foundation of their obligations in the covenant that the Lord had first cut with their fathers, and, again, was doing so—but now with them right on the borders of Canaan.\n\nHence, we ask: Might there be parallels with what the children of Israel, on the borders of the Promised Land, faced—and what we, today, right on the border of the Promised Land (only a much better one), face as well?\n\nThus, the topic for this quarter is called “Present Truth in Deuteronomy.” And that’s what we’re going to look at: present truth messages that we can take from God’s words to His covenant people.\n\nIn this quarter, we will look at Deuteronomy topically, covering such themes as the everlasting covenant, law and grace, what it means to love God and your neighbor, and—most important of all—how the book of Deuteronomy reveals to us the love of God, which was most powerfully made manifest in the death of Jesus on the cross and His resurrection.\n\nSure, a vast time and cultural divide separates our church today from the church in the wilderness. But perhaps what we have in common with them might be more than what divides us from them. For example, could not the following words be spoken to us as well?\n\n“ ‘Surely I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as the Lord my God commanded me, that you should act according to them in the land which you go to possess.\n\n“ ‘Therefore be careful to observe them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people” ’ ” (Deut. 4:5, 6, NKJV).\n\nNotice, it wasn’t the laws themselves that were their “wisdom and understanding” before the nations—but their obedience to those laws. Certainly, there’s a message for us here, just one of many, as we will see, in the book of Deuteronomy.\n\nClifford R.

We can’t just listen to what Jesus asks of us—we are to do it (James 1:22) if we want to be effective agents of the kingdom on this earth.\n\nThe first lesson of each quarter covers a different section of Jesus’ sermon on the mount, which is “at once Christ’s inaugural address as king of the kingdom of grace and also the constitution of the kingdom” (The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 322).\n\nAfter the first lesson of each quarter the rest of the lessons are about the different challenges, rights, or privileges in the “real time” of being an agent of God’s kingdom. A Christian never knows what he or she will be encountering next.\n\nRemember to go to http://guidemagazine.org/rtf and explore each week’s topic with other e-teens. Find out how other young people are facing the challenge of living for God in the real world.\n\n**How to use this bible study guide**\n\n**Step 1**: Notice that this Bible study guide isn’t meant to be read like a usual magazine or book. Each lesson comes out of the binding to be used as a separate sheet for study in advance during the week in preparation for Sabbath School. Be sure to take the right lesson to Sabbath School with you each week.\n\n**Step 2**: Use each week’s lesson in the way that is best for you. Each section has a day of the week listed beside it, but you may want to mix and match sections as you study. The sections work in any order.\n\n**Step 3**: Review the memory verse each day of the week.\n\n**Step 4**: Be prepared to share your thoughts and discoveries with your Sabbath School class.",

If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

In these lessons the children will be introduced to three major themes—service through following Jesus’ example; experiencing God’s grace by being part of His family; and worshipping by praising Jesus for what He has done for us.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child.

        "introduction": "### Introduction\n\nDuring the time when Josiah was king (640–609 b.c.), a person in Jerusalem found a book. Someone read the book to King Josiah. “When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes to show he was sad and upset” (2 Kings 22:11, ERV). Why was the king sad and upset? Because he saw that he and his people were not obeying the laws written in the book.\n\nThis book was known as the Book of the Agreement (2 Kings 23:2, ERV). This book caused Josiah to make many big changes for the better in the land. We can read in 2 Kings 23 about the changes Josiah made.\n\nWe believe the book that caused Josiah to make all these big changes was Deuteronomy. We shall study this book this quarter.\n\nDeuteronomy is the 5th book in the set of books known as the Five Books of Moses. The name Deuteronomy comes from the Latin word “deuteronomium.” “Deuteronomium” means “second law.”\n\nWhat is Deuteronomy all about?\n\nDeuteronomy is all about the time when Israel was getting ready to enter the Promised Land. 40 years before, the children of Israel left Egypt. They made an agreement with the Lord at Sinai. Then they walked around in the desert for the next 40 years. When they finished walking for 40 years, Moses talked with the people. He gave them many messages from the Lord. Moses said almost the same as these words to the Israelites: “You are about to enter the Promised Land. Finally! Do not forget everything the Lord has done for you. Do not forget everything He asks of you now. He wants you to love Him with all your heart and mind. He also wants you to show Him and other people that you love Him by obeying all the commandments that are written in the agreement.” Of course, these words are not the exact words Moses said. But these words come very close. They show us the chief message of Deuteronomy: remember the agreement.\n\nMoses wanted the people to understand that the agreement with God was very impor­tant. So, Moses told them the Ten Commandments again. The Ten Commandments showed the people everything they must do for God. God first made this agreement with their fathers. Now the Lord makes the same agreement again with them, the children of Israel. God makes this agreement right before they can cross into the Promised Land.\n\nWe, too, stand on the borders of the Promised Land. That Promised Land is heaven. What can we learn from the experience of Israel that can help us now?\n\nThe name of the Bible study guide for this quarter is “Deuteronomy: The Truth We Need Most for Our Time.” Another name for the truth we need most for our time is “present truth.” This quarter, we will look at present-truth messages in Deuteronomy. We will see what these messages can teach us.\n\nWe will study Deuteronomy by looking at different topics in the book. Some of these topics include: (1) the agreement that continues forever, (2) law and mercy, and (3) loving God and our neighbor. Most important of all, we will look at how Deuteronomy shows us the love of God. This love was shown in a powerful way in the death of Jesus for us on the cross and His waking up from the dead.\n\nSure, thousands of years separate our church today from the “church” in the desert. But maybe we and Israel are more alike than we are different. Moses said many words to Israel that, for sure, have meaning for us as a church today. Here is one example: “ ‘I taught you the laws and rules that the Lord my God commanded me. I did this so you could obey them in the land you are ready to enter and take for your own. Obey these laws carefully. This will show the people of the other nations [countries] that you are wise and sensible [understanding]. They will hear about these laws and say, “Truly [for sure], the people of this great nation are wise and sensible” ’ ” (Deuteronomy 4:5, 6, ERV).\n\nDo you see that the laws do not show that Israel is a wise and understanding people? If we do not obey laws, then laws are worth nothing. So, the laws God gave Israel did not show that Israel was wise. Their obedience to these laws did. There is a lesson for us here, for sure. Just one of many lessons, as we will see, from the book of Deuteronomy.\n\n_Clifford R. Goldstein is editor of the Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide.

        "introduction": "### Introduction to The Book of Deuteronomy\n\nThe name Deuteronomy means “second law,” but the title in Hebrew is “these are the words.” The latter actually reflects the heart of the book, since it is not really law at all, but covenant. These are the words from God’s heart to yours. The words of Deuteronomy are timeless, and each succeeding generation is to live and remember as if they experienced the Exodus miracles themselves. As a covenant, Deuteronomy highlights first what God has done for His people, and then describes the loving obedience that the people are to respond with in gratitude. Three main themes of Deuteronomy are love, heart, and life.\n\nLove. God is love, and God loves first. Throughout the book of Deuteronomy, God’s love shines clearly. And it is to strike an answering chord of love in the hearts of the people, as they in return “love the Lord” with everything they have and are (Deut. 6:5). The love between God and His people then flows out in love for others, even and especially for those who are vulnerable and oppressed. Because the people understand vulnerability and oppression, as God rescued them from certain death and slavery, they are to live out the power of God’s love toward those in need. God loves the vulnerable and calls His people to love as they have been loved (Deut. 10:18, 19).\n\nHeart. In order to truly love God, one’s heart must be in tune with His. But human hearts are wicked and stubborn, prone to wander and rebel. They need circumcision of the heart to be open to responding to God’s love (Deut. 10:16). The profound message of Deuteronomy is that we cannot even change our own hearts, but God in His great mercy promises to do the circumcision for us (Deut. 30:6). Then His heart’s dream can come true as He grows closer and closer in deep and true relationship with each one of His people. God also promises to put His words in our hearts, making it possible for us to walk in His ways and for Him to bless us (Deut. 30:14–16). And once again, it is when our hearts turn away that we are led into sin and destruction (Deut. 30:17, 18). God wants our hearts; it is all about the heart.\n\nLife. The book of Deuteronomy is life itself, because it is God’s words of love to our hearts. God’s people live “by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord” (Deut. 8:3). And yet, the reason that the Torah is life is that it comes from and points us back to the heart of God. God is life Himself, and calls us to “choose life” (Deut. 30:19)! He does not want anyone to die, but for all to find their “length of days” (ESV) as they “cling” to Him (Deut. 30:20). Unfortunately, Israel quickly forgot to read this book of life. And yet, every time they found and read it again, often after decades or even centuries of neglect, repentance and reformation resulted. This book changes lives, because it leads us to the living God, who is our life!\n\nThe importance of this book to the rest of Scripture cannot be overstated. It forms the foundation for all the historical books, as the authors expect the reader to know Deuteronomy in order to accurately judge the actions of each character as right or wrong. The prophets eat and breathe Deuteronomy, as they portray God pulling out all the stops to try and reach His rebellious and utterly wicked people. They alternatively warn people about the impending and increasing curses, and plead with them to return to God and His blessings. In addition, Deuteronomy is wisdom itself, and deeply influences many of the statements in the wisdom literature. Even in the New Testament, Deuteronomy is often quoted or alluded to by Jesus and Paul, forming the center of Jesus’ plea for a response from a heart of love, not legalistic actions. Revelation portrays the final choices that people make between life and death, along with the blessings and curses that result, respectively. Deuteronomy is truly the heart of all Scripture, so it is no wonder that the king was to write his own copy of the book and read from it every day (Deut. 17:18–20). As the king was to be an example to the people, the implication is that each individual should do the same.\n\nSo, as you read this book, let God’s love fill your heart with life and joy. Let your heart be opened to new revelations of God’s grace and mercy. Be inspired to tell people about truth and power contained in Deuteronomy. Most of all, fall in love ever more with the Author of Deuteronomy, your Creator and Redeemer, who longs for you to know His heart of love and experience life forever with Him!",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day.

We will be in for quite a ride,” the voice from the cockpit said in ending the announcement.\n\nSoon after, the plane began to shake violently as it fought its way through the storm.

She was busy drawing a picture on the open tray table before her. Now and again she would look out the small window at a particularly impressive lightning strike, but then she would calmly resume her drawing.\n\nAfter what seemed half an eternity, the plane finally landed at its destination. Passengers cheered and clapped, so grateful and relieved to be back on the ground. The little girl had packed her bag and was waiting for people to leave the plane when one of the travelers asked her if she hadn’t been afraid. How could she be that calm during such a major storm and with the plane shaking so much?\n\n“I wasn’t scared,” the little girl said to the surprised man. “My dad is the pilot, and I knew he was taking me home.”\n\nRestlessness and fear often go hand in hand. Living in a world that keeps most people busy 24-7 can result in restlessness and fear in our lives. Who doesn’t, at times, struggle with fear, with worry, and with dread of what the future holds? The past is done, the present is now; but the future is full of questions, and in this unstable world, the answers might not be what we want to hear. We wonder if we will be able to make a looming deadline, to cover the next rent or school payment, or to make our struggling marriages survive another storm. We wonder if God can continue to love us, even though we “disappoint” Him again and again.\n\nIn this quarter, we will tackle some of those fears head on. Rest in Christ is not just a title for a study guide or the captivating logo of an evangelistic campaign or camp meeting. Resting in Christ is the key to the type of life that Jesus promises to His followers: “ ‘The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly’ ” (John 10:10, NKJV).\n\nAs the authors worked on this study guide, they suddenly realized the all-­pervasiveness of the concept of rest in the texture of biblical theology. Rest connects to salvation, to grace, to Creation, to the Sabbath, to our understanding of the state of the dead, to the soon coming of Jesus—and to so much more.\n\nWhen Jesus invited us to come and find rest in Him (Matt. 11:28), He not only addressed His disciples or the early Christian church. He also saw future generations of sin-sick, weary, worn-out, struggling human beings who needed access to the Source of rest. As you study the weekly lessons during this quarter, remember to come, and rest in Him. After all, our heavenly Father is in control and is ready to bring us home safely.\n\nChantal and Gerald Klingbeil enjoy a cross-cultural marriage and working as a team.

Each lesson comes out of the binding to be used as a separate sheet for study in advance during the week in preparation for Sabbath School. Be sure to take the right lesson to Sabbath School with you each week.\n\n**Step 2**: Use each week’s lesson in the way that is best for you. Each section has a day of the week listed beside it, but you may want to mix and match sections as you study. The sections work in any order.\n\n**Step 3**: Review the memory verse each day of the week.\n\n**Step 4**: Be prepared to share your thoughts and discoveries with your Sabbath School class.",

If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

In these lessons the children will be introduced to three major themes—service through following Jesus’ example; experiencing God’s grace by being part of His family; and worshipping by praising Jesus for what He has done for us.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child. Let us pray for one another as we work together to lead little ones to Jesus.\n\nContact us through our Web site at www.gracelink.net. - Cordially, The Editors",

For one thing, the Bible contains many narratives and teachings regarding sexuality. In the primary religious text for Christianity, sexuality is inescapable. Second, in recent years, because of the various approaches in understanding and interpreting the Bible, some Christian denominations have taken several eyebrow-raising stances on diverse sexual issues. After understanding sexuality from the entire Bible and only the Bible, we can see that some of these stances are quite erroneous, if not dangerous in their ramifications! Last, sexuality is so much a part of the human experience that any serious believer will want to understand what the Bible has to say about it.\n\nAfter studying this topic, it may be shocking to see that the Bible is quite positive toward sexuality. Furthermore, the negative tones often associated with the “church” point to the larger problem of misunderstanding and even mishandling of Scripture. It will be clear that God is the Author of sexuality, and its proper understanding may raise eyebrows in another way.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the libertine world, where all forms of morality, restriction, and guidance are considered chaff. Even before the advent of the internet, sexuality and its associated issues started to rise in importance and visibility, commensurate with the expansion of media. Now with the ubiquity of the digital world, sexuality has saturated nearly every sphere of society.\n\nWhere are believers of Jesus and Scripture to stand? It is precisely for the prevalence of misunderstanding biblical sexuality that this quarter will be addressing this taboo subject. No Bible study series can fully exhaust the study of sexuality. It will not comprehensively address every issue, hypothetical and corollary, that is associated with the topic. That task would be too exhaustive and would take more than 13 weeks. Rather the basic principles of sexuality will be drawn out each week, allowing the readers to adapt, apply, and intersect the principles to their own real world. As the discussions regarding sexuality have so many nuances and different contexts, biblical principles will help believers navigate through personal circumstances.\n\nIn this issue of inVerse, the topic of sexuality will be addressed from the perspective of both the Old and New Testaments. It will present the function, purpose, and gift of sexuality that God created and intended for humanity, not as a polemic or an apologetic, but as a study seeking God’s goodness. The first couple of lessons establish the Bible as the prime territory from which our data is mined and where the purpose of sexuality is found. Lesson 3 establishes that although sexuality is a gift from God, its practice is not mandated for all humanity. The next five lessons look at sexuality from the biblical characteristics of goodness, oneness, duality, sameness, and difference. The remaining lessons approach sexuality from other perspectives, seeking to diagnose and provide restorative principles.\n\nIn an era when sexuality is made so common and profane, it is the desire of the authors to increase the dialog regarding sexuality and its associated issues, especially in the arena of the church, Scripture, and faith. It is our desire to explore the holiness of the topic and its true positive purpose for humanity as a gift. Additionally, this topic presents principles presuppositions that will set up future discussions on religious liberty, faith and science, hermeneutics, last-day events, and more.\n\nThis behemoth topic is not meant to be a marriage counseling guide or a textbook on biological and sexual issues. It is not meant as a primer on theological propositions or as a practical handbook. Rather it is presented merely as a starting point for young-adult Christ-followers to take the Bible as a whole, seriously, and, inspired by the Spirit, to find answers to the yearnings of the soul.",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nCordially, The Editors",

They want you to know more about God and His love for you and your family. And that’s what God wants too. He wants you to know that He loves you very much. And Jesus wants to be your special, forever friend. He wants you to know Him, to know all about Him. He wants you to be His friend too.\n\nAs you learn more about God’s love in these lessons, think about ways you can show your love to Him. Can you sing a song of praise to Him? Can you tell Him in your prayers how wonderful He is? Can you show His love to others in your family? To your friends and neighbors?\n\nWe pray that God will always have a special place in your heart. The Editors",

If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child.

Which texts would you use in a Bible study about the promises of God? Which texts do you naturally resonate with?\n\nDepending on the degree of your biblical familiarity, you may choose one set over the other. How can the Bible appear to make such strong statements on both sides and make such a confusing presentation about the same divine covenant, birthed in such an ideal culture, so positively committed to building relationships on every level? Is it as simple as the idea that the Sinai covenant, once life giving, suddenly turned lethal once the new covenant showed up? Or is something deeper going on here? Could it be that a covenant code exists that, once broken, might reveal a more profound truth? Could there be an answer that resolves the apparent contradictions and turns up the volume on an impassioned appeal the Covenant Maker is making to His endangered children?\n\nWelcome to a mystery that has confounded many experts over centuries. In this inVerse Bible study guide, step by patient, deliberate, prayerful step, we will seriously address these issues and seek to “decode the covenant.” The first five lessons in this series will provide a general introduction to the biblical covenants, especially the “old” and “new” covenants, and will identify the issues involved in analyzing the apparently conflicting passages noted above. The next six lessons evaluate these passages from a historical and experiential perspective. The last two lessons focus on applications of God’s covenant(s) to our lives personally. What will emerge is a more confident understanding of the covenants, a clarity over the apparent dissonance and contradiction, and a deeper dependence on Jesus and experience of meeting Him afresh along the way.",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

This gives your child a better opportunity to learn concepts emphasized throughout the month and to offer more repetition. Children at this age learn best through repetition.\n\nThe three lessons in this Bible study guide focus on serving God by caring for others; God bringing His love to us; and the birth of Jesus. Activities in the Do & Say section at the end of each lesson teach and reinforce these three important concepts.\n\nNow is the time to help your child start to learn about God’s Word, the Bible. Show your child the memory verses in your Bible. Then use the motions to help reinforce the text. Be an example. Let him or her see you reading God’s Word every day.\n\nAs you share these lessons with your child, take time to pray a short prayer, sing a happy song, read with enthusiasm, and have fun with the Do & Say activities as part of your family worship. Involve your young child in worship now, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last.\n\nMake the time—take the time—to worship with your child every day. Years from now you’ll be glad you did.\n\nCordially, The Editors",

Each lesson comes out of the binding to be used as a separate sheet for study in advance during the week in preparation for Sabbath School. Be sure to take the right lesson to Sabbath School with you each week.\n\n**Step 2**: Use each week’s lesson in the way that is best for you. Each section has a day of the week listed beside it, but you may want to mix and match sections as you study. The sections work in any order.\n\n**Step 3**: Review the memory verse each day of the week.\n\n**Step 4**: Be prepared to share your thoughts and discoveries with your Sabbath School class.",

If the Lord knows each star by name and makes sure that it is in the proper place each night (Isaiah 40:26), how much more important are you?\n\nNot every person is alike. Look around you. Everyone has different color eyes, hair, skin, and build (tall, short, big-boned, and thin). We all learn differently. Some people learn by listening, others by sight, and still others by touch. Some people use all three ways to learn.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, the Lord wants you to love Him and serve Him with all your heart. You do that when you pray, learn about Him (in your lesson study), talk about Him to others, and do what is right.\n\nHere is a great truth you should know about the Lord: Jesus isn’t primarily concerned about how well you can read or write, or even how well you can speak. What Jesus cares about most is how much you love Him and want Him in your life. The greatest accomplishment in your life will be to show others how much God has blessed your life.\n\nIn school you use different ways to get the information that you want. Use those same ways to learn more about the Lord: Use your computer, iPod, or iPad to hear or study your lesson. Or have your parents read your lesson to you. Use the Bible on CD, or the audio podcast of your lesson at www.juniorpowerpoints.org /podcast.php?channel=1. It does not matter which way you get the information, as long as you are growing and maturing in the Lord.\n\nThink about this when you meet Jesus face to face: He is not going to ask to see how well you write something. He will not ask you to read anything. His only pursuit is to read your heart to see how much you love Him. He wants to spend eternity with you!\n\n### How to use this Bible study guide\n\nThe lessons and stories in this Bible study guide include principles that you can apply to your everyday life. They encourage you to communicate with God through prayer, reading from your Bible, and reflecting on what you read. That is how to grow in your relationship with Jesus. You will study the Bible lesson during the week, and in Sabbath School you will review it with your teacher and peers. This review process will help you gain a deeper spiritual understanding of the lessons.\n\nA big part of your Sabbath School lesson is the study you do from the Bible and the discussions you have with your teachers and peers on Sabbath. Learn and review the power text during the week as you prepare for Sabbath School. As you memorize passages from the Bible you will become familiar- ized with the truths found in God’s Word, and you will learn to apply them to your life. As you study your Sabbath School lesson, engage your family members in discussion and share with them what you learned.\n\nMost important, please take time to read, pray, and reflect on Jesus every day. Ask Him to help you apply what you study to what you do in real life. It isn’t only what you know with your head, but it’s also what you know with your heart, that helps you be a strong, growing Christian.\n\nHappy growing in Jesus! —The Editor\n",

In these lessons the children will be introduced to three major themes—service through following Jesus’ example; experiencing God’s grace by being part of His family; and worshipping by praising Jesus for what He has done for us.\n\nWe believe that kindergarten children are able to understand God’s messages in Scripture, so we urge you to sit with your child each day to share the lesson. As part of your family worship, pray for understanding from the Holy Spirit; sing a happy song; read with enthusiasm; and have fun with the Do and Say activities. Use the motions to review the memory verse. This will help your child remember it.\n\nLet your child tell you the story from the pictures or help to read the lesson if he or she is able. Read the story from the Bible at some time during the week. A number of simplified children’s versions are available today. Teach by example and word that the Bible is precious and holy.\n\nTake the time—make the time—to involve your young child in worship every day, and you will foster a love for Jesus and His Word that will last. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nOur prayer is that these lessons will bring joy and peace to you and your child.

        "introduction": "### Introduction\n\nIn the nearly two thousand years since the apostle Paul penned his letter to the Romans, scientific and technological changes have radically transformed society. Despite the dramatic changes that have taken hold of the world, the fundamental problems humanity faces remain unchanged. The book of Romans addresses the unchanging realities of the human condition and provides a solution for the challenges we face through the saving work of Jesus. \n\nAccording to Paul, humanity’s fundamental problem is that it has denied the obvious; that there is a Creator, and He deserves our loyalty, love, and worship. One look at the night sky, the majestic mountains, or the intricacies of biological systems should convince the most ardent skeptic that God is. By denying what is self-evident, we have alienated ourselves from the life-giving God (Romans 1:20–31).\n\nRomans reminds us that our alienation began when our first father, Adam, alienated himself from God in the garden (Romans 5:12–19). Through his failure, he unleashed upon the world the twin problems of sin and death. Unfortunately, we followed in his footsteps and have contributed to the destruction of God’s good world by our own rebellion against the Creator.\n\nAccording to Paul, the sad reality is that alienation from God comes at a tremendous human cost, a cost we see paid in human suffering. Alienation from God gave human nature a bent to addiction. It has infused us with a persistent inability to do right even when we want to do right. Alienation from God has led to moral confusion (Romans 7:15–24). It has deeply wounded God’s good creation with environmental degradation (Romans 8:18–23). \n\nRomans reveals that alienation from God has manifested itself in the breakdown of our relationships. Paul sees it in our tendency to gossip (Romans 1:29). It is evident in parent-child discord (Romans 1:30). It is apparent in the disordering of our sexuality (Romans 1:24–27). We witness it every time we pass judgment on others (Romans 2:1). It is evident in our religious hypocrisy (Romans 2:17–24). It happens when church members quarrel over their opinions (Romans 14:1). It is seen in the racial, ethnic, and religious tensions that plague society (Romans 1:16, 17; 2:7–11; 3:21–24, 28–30; 4:3–16; 9:8, 22–33; 10:11–13; 11:32; 15:7–12; 16:25–27). Like the Romans, we face these same issues. We meet them at work and at school. We face them with our friends and colleagues. We face them in our romantic relationships and marriages. We see them played out in the social and political problems that plague our world. Most sobering is that we meet them in the darkest recesses of our own hearts and minds.\n\nRomans also tells the story of God’s plan to remove our alienation from Him and replace it with reconciliation. Reconciliation with God doesn’t happen because we took the initiative. We were actively fleeing the presence of God (Romans 3:11b, 12a). Reconciliation doesn’t come through our works. Our works are a mess. Reconciliation doesn’t come through the law. The law merely alerts us to our need for reconciliation (Romans 3:19, 20). Reconciliation comes from God’s initiative as a gift of His grace. Through Jesus’ redeeming and justifying death, we are reconciled to God (Romans 5:10). Acrimony, fear, guilt, shame, and condemnation are all replaced with peace with God (Romans 5:1). God welcomes us into His family as beloved children. And now, God couldn’t be any closer to us than He is, since He lives within believers by the Spirit (Romans 8:9–14).\n\nRomans moves from alienation to reconciliation and from reconciliation to restoration (Romans 8:9–23). In and through the church, God is restoring us to a united human family held together by the presence of the Spirit in each member. This new community is bound together so tightly that it’s as if we were each different parts of the same body (Romans 12:3–8). In this new community, we are called to extend Christ’s reconciling mission by welcoming one another as Christ welcomed us (Romans 15:7). According to Paul, the church is to be the place that embodies the reconciling and restoring work of Christ by pointing its members to relational, moral, and social restoration.\n\nBelievers are to pursue reconciliation and restoration as we live out, through the Spirit’s power, the sincere love and tender affection that God revealed in Christ on the cross (Romans 12:9–13:10). While we wait for the restoration of all things when Jesus returns, Romans urges us to work for reconciliation and restoration now.\n\nThe message of Romans is as relevant today as the day it was written. Human nature is unchanged. Our society, communities, and congregations still confront the same alienation, division, and relational breakdown that the Romans faced. Over the next thirteen weeks, follow this study on the book of Romans as we join Paul’s path to reconciliation and restoration by God’s grace.",

This big story continues from the first gener- ation in Eden to your generation today. It’s about the lives of people as the God of the universe interacts with them.\n\nIf you are looking for a word from God that is real, Cornerstone Connections captures the message of Scripture and challenges you to make the connec- tions to your real life.\n\nGod’s Word is not only real; it is rock-solid. For the first generation to hear God’s voice in the garden as well as the last group standing before Christ at the Second Coming, the Word of God has been and continues to be reliable.\n\nThe word from God comes to us in the stories of people who encoun- tered Him and made a decision to either follow Him or walk away.\n\nReal. Solid. Stories. You will find one in Into the Story in each lesson. Out of the Story will provide you with ways to search for truth you can apply to your life. In each lesson you will also find:\n \n- What Do You Think?—a mental activity to get your mind and heart in gear for the story to follow. Every time you approach a Bible story, you are coming to it in the context of the story in which you live every day.\n- Did You Know?—a brief statistic or definition that digs a little deeper into the story or simply provides some helpful facts to bring to the lesson.\n- Key Text—a verse that points out a key concept from the story. It is also a great place to find verses that you can memorize and store away for later use.\n- Punch Lines—a few other verses from Scripture that punctuate key concepts of the lesson. You may see connections between them and the Bible story as well as your own life.\n- Flashlight—a brief snapshot of Ellen White’s input on the story. These glimmers that shed light onto the biblical passage will also give you a glimpse of what awaits you in the suggested weekly reading from her inspired commentary on the stories—the Conflict of the Ages.*\n- Further Insight—one or two quotes that will provide further insight into the central message of the lesson.\n- Connecting to Life—the guide to making the truths about God in this story your very own. Study the Bible lesson during the week in prepa- ration for Sabbath School. On Sabbath you will have the opportunity to review, discuss, and elaborate on what you learned with your teacher and other students in your Sabbath School class. Each day of the week you will be directed to explore one of the sections of the lesson, to relate it to the story you live, and to make the message from God apply to you personally.\n\nWelcome to Cornerstone Connections. — The Editors\n\nPS: Don’t forget to check out the reading plan.",

        "introduction": "### Introduction\n\nHistorically, education and theology have consistently been connected. \n\nThe University of Bologna, believed to have been founded in 1088, has traditionally been considered the oldest continuously operating university in the world. Some attribute the rapid growth of the university to its purpose of training clergy in public speaking and the fulfillment of other ecclesiastical duties. From the outset, the university stressed the importance of law, theology, medicine, and philosophy in its assistance to the church.\n\nWhen the Seventh-day Adventist Church emerged, education continued to carry theological implications, although a more modern approach to the university and learning had begun to evolve. It was during this period that higher criticism become popular in the study of Scripture. The nineteenth century saw Charles Darwin, a seminary-bound student, alter his course in such a way that it would eventually lead to the publication of his work on evolution. Political and philosophical ideologies emerged that challenged the basic assumptions of inspiration, the supernatural, and even morality itself. The Adventist movement was not immune to these challenges. The worlds of education and theology conflicted around the role of the knowledge of God in education.\n\nThis was the context in which the Seventh-day Adventist Church developed a systematic and theologically grounded system of education, as defined in Ellen White’s work, Education. For Adventists, biblical and missional implications underlie the purpose, method, and intent of education. These necessitate a unique model that is distinctive in nature, making it a system unlike any other.\n\n“True education means more than a pursual of a certain course of study” (Education, p. 13). Rather than consisting of only academic qualification, it must consider the entire person wholistically as well as the practical usefulness of that person in the present and future. In this “harmonious development” of the individual, the spiritual, mental, and physical attributes cannot be compartmentalized into separate equal parts, but rather the student must find God infused in every aspect of the total person. \n\nThe model of education given to the Seventh-day Adventist Church by the writings of Ellen G. White will be the focus of this study. It will be divided into five sections, where the first section deals with the importance of God in the life of the student and the first three lessons address the biblical and practical reasons why this is critical—without Him, education cannot be possible. \n\nSection 2 will address the two foundational principles that education stands on: excellence and unselfishness. Section 3 will address the unique aspects of education in Adventism by looking at how this unique system of education parallels the unique message of the everlasting gospel in the book of Revelation. The relationship between education and character, faith, and the Sabbath is a systemic element unique to an Adventist approach to learning. \n\nThe fourth section of this study will look at three case studies: the biblical sanctuary; the schools of the prophets; and the lives of men and women used by God to accomplish great things for their nations. Finally, the study will conclude with God’s ultimate purpose for education, which is the establishment of a new kingdom. \n\nAs you study these lessons, approach the topic of education as an ambassador of a different world tasked with the responsibility of infiltrating enemy lines. Consider God’s system of education as your training to successfully accomplish this task. Be open to the possibility that a total transformation to the way you think will be necessary. Do not forget that the war you are engaged in is actually a real controversy between God and Satan. Finally, take courage in the assurance that the war has been won, and by God’s grace, He will use you to reach heights that are “higher than the highest human thought can reach” (Education, p. 19).

        "introduction": "### Introduction\n\nFor a while, the word discipleship was a buzzword in many religious and spiritual circles. The religious ones spun the term to mean the implementation of ritual and religious habits. Their emphasis was on discipline and training. The spiritual ones reinterpreted discipleship to mean following the esoteric Jesus of history. Recast as a hippie vagabond life, discipleship meant being free from theory and theology but obsessed, instead, with an esoteric and mystical quest for fulfillment.\n\nIn reality, discipleship simply means to follow Jesus. Though this may sound simplistic and derivative, it incorporates more than the Christian cliché of “following Him.” It does retain some discipline and training as well as spiritual fulfillment. But biblical discipleship transcends popular church programs and trendy curricula. Relevant to His disciples today more than ever, discipleship at the core is about Christ’s teachings, Christ’s way of living, and an organic relationship with Jesus.\n\nThis quarter will look at different foundations for discipleship. We will address the instruments of discipleship, the goal of discipleship, the power of discipleship, the process of discipleship, the venue for discipleship, and the attitude of discipleship. Because discipleship is about all of these—relationships, the devotional life, spiritual development, and the life of the church—only a comprehensive study could be effective. \n\nBefore starting the study, we must establish some presuppositions. First, the Bible is the source of this ongoing process of discipleship. The process is ongoing because we never quit the discipleship course; its dynamicity causes us to grow perpetually, and our maturation is continual for eternity. And this spiritual growth takes its cue from within the Word of God.\n\nSecond, the study seeks to address a large problem in the church: many are leaving. While many may quote the lack of love or the problem of particular doctrines (or even the concept of doctrine itself) as reasons for leaving, this study argues that the exodus is caused by a lack of personal “real” time with God. Therefore, discipleship is seen as the answer to nurturing and retaining Christians in the church. Simply stated, each lesson will address how to get back to connecting with the Lord Jesus. Each week’s study adds another part of the picture so that, at the end, we will create a composite picture of biblical discipleship.\n\nThe third presupposition is that many leave the church because of stubborn habits that exist in the church. Some of these habits include the mentality that pastors are to conduct evangelism while everyone else is merely a “member.” It is the goal of this study to do away with “member” mentality so that we understand our identity as disciples of Jesus. Other habits will be mentioned throughout the study; it will be advantageous to see whether these habits exist in your church. Prayerfully seek the Lord’s grace in pardon and power to overcome these cultural barriers.\n\nThough the study seeks to be as practical as possible, at the end of the day the study is in fact merely that—a study. Discipleship does not happen by chance. Habits are not changed overnight. Definitions are not reworked in a day. Members do not become self-denying workers by accident. Consumers hardly become producers by nature. Instead of merely trudging through this booklet for three months, take a prayerful attitude to see how real heavenly change can be wrought. The goal of this study guide is to ask the Lord to change our hearts, change our churches, and change the world by His grace.",

Typically the time period starts in the late teens and ranges up to the mid-thirties and even to the early forties. According to LinkedIn research, 72 percent of young professionals have experienced some form of the crisis. Though it ebbs and flows, QLC peaks at around 26 years and nine months and lasts about 11 months. It consists of lacking a sense of direction, quality of life, and purpose. The person has a general anxiety over finances, relationships, and career. While some have attributed QLC specifically to the millennial generation (a demographic defined as those born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s), a variety of the features can be found in every generation and are specifically manifested in the years as a young adult.\n\nWhat characterizes this crisis is the fear of making major decisions in life. Some questions spark QLC immediately. What am I going to major in? What should I do for my career? How will I pay my loans? Who will I marry? Should I marry at all? Should I rent or get a mortgage? Where should I live? What about retirement? How many kids? Why kids at all? Should I get a graduate degree? Why and where from? What about my parents? Why should I worry about my parents? Why haven’t I figured out these things yet? (Apologies if you are experiencing an anxiety attack now.) And these are just the basic life-decision questions. A plethora of other decisions need to be made on a daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonable basis.\n\nWhat also characterizes QLC is anxiety regarding relationships. German psychologist Erik. H. Erikson proposed eight existential crises in which the young adult conflict entailed the struggle between intimacy and isolation. “Finding one’s self” was followed by finding intense relationships, whether platonic or romantic. Not only do decisions about life need to be made but social decisions affecting the lives of others are also pending. Our technology-saturated society imposes social media, while an unpredictable globalized economy pushes financial uncertainties into the frenetic decision-making mind, resulting in QLC carnage and splatter everywhere. As novel technology and real-time finances affect relationships, the social decisions that need to be made get more and more complex, and yesterday’s experience and precedent become less and less relevant (or do they?).\n\nLastly, the decisions made in our twenties affect the quality (and even quantity) of the rest of our lives. In other words, the effects of the decisions made during the quarter-life period compound into our senior years. They are not isolated to one stage of life. Rather, they reverberate through the decades, with some coming to full fruition years later, when they can only be objectively evaluated.\n\nWhile contemporary culture espouses the memes of “life hacking,” “YOLO” (“you only live once”) and “no regrets,” good and fulfilled living is nothing new. Jonathan Edwards wrote in his journal Resolution #52 on July 8, 1723: “I frequently hear persons in old age say how they would live, if they were to live their lives over again: Resolved, that I will live just so as I can think I shall wish I had done, supposing I live to old age.” Looking further back than that, the apostle Paul wrote, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith,” in 2 Timothy 4:7. Living the best life possible is nothing new, for there is nothing new under the sun, as Solomon echoes (over and over and over again . . . ).\n\nLiving life without regrets is a noble virtue. But how to live without regrets or, in other words, how to make the best decisions is another story. In living the fullest moment, people often forget about living the fullest lifetime. Living only once can also be translated as dying only once. You want to be saying “no regrets” in your twenties as well as in your nineties. How can you live this life? How can you avoid the pitfalls of QLC? How do you live at all?\n\nThis is where the God of the Bible reveals the best light on life. Transcending the questions and laws of religion, the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures present united and consistent principles on making the best decisions. From marriage to money and purpose to passion, the Bible addresses life’s greatest questions, regardless of generation and regardful of the human condition. May the Lord bless as you study, contemplate, apply, and live the principles of knowing God’s will.\n\n“Those who decide to do nothing in any line that will displease God, will know, after presenting their case before Him, just what course to pursue. And they will receive not only wisdom, but strength. Power for obedience, for service, will be imparted to them, as Christ has promised.” (The Desire of Ages, 668)",

        "introduction": "### Introduction\n\nCan the book of Daniel have any practical bearing on our lives today? Is it relevant to twenty-first century living? The answer is found in the words of Jesus in Matthew 24:15, where He gives an unmistakable book endorsement: “’Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place’ (whoever reads let him understand),”\n\nNotice these ideas found within Jesus’ endorsement of the book of Daniel:\n\n1. Daniel is an inspired prophet and by implication the book of Daniel is trustworthy. \n2. The book of Daniel should be read and studied. \n3. The book of Daniel will be understood. \n4. The prophecies within the book of Daniel will be fulfilled. \n5. The book of Daniel’s message is relevant and practical for end time living. (Leslie Hardinge, Jesus is My Judge, p. 1)\n\nAccording to Jesus, the book of Daniel is indeed relevant for twenty-first century end-time living. Daniel literally means “God is my Judge.” Laodicea, God’s last day church, means a “people judged.” Thus, Daniel can be seen as a type of God’s people that will be living during the time of judgment just prior to the second coming of Jesus. \n\nThe book of Daniel has within it two main genres: stories and prophecies. There are eight stories; six of the stories depict characteristics that we are to seek to emulate as the prophecies are being fulfilled and two of the stories depict characteristics that we are to seek to avoid as the prophecies are being fulfilled (c.f. Leslie Hardinge, Jesus is My Judge, p. 6).\n\nThis series of inVerse lessons on the book of Daniel will be divided into two main sections. The first section will be focusing on the eight stories in Daniel and drawing practical applications to our daily lives. The second section will be dealing with the main prophecies in Daniel. \n\nEllen White indicates there are rich blessings in store for those who read and study the book of Daniel: “When the books of Daniel and Revelation are better understood, believers will have an entirely different religious experience. They will be given such glimpses of the open gates of heaven that heart and mind will be impressed with the character that all must develop in order to realize the blessedness which is to be the reward of the pure in heart” (Ellen White, Testimonies to Ministers, p. 114).\n\nThe book of Daniel is relevant, enriching, practical, and essential for end-time living. \n\nMay the promised blessing found within Jesus’ endorsement of Daniel be yours.
